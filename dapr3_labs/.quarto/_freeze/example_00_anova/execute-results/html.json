Each participant completed 20 trials in which they were tasked with throwing a basketball and scoring a goal in order to score points. The number of points up for grabs varied between trials, ranging from 1 to 20 points, with the order randomised for each participant. If a participant successfully threw the ball in the basket, then their score increased accordingly. If they missed, their score decreased accordingly. Participants were informed of the number of points available prior to each throw.  \n\nTo examine the influence of the *type* of reward/loss on stress-levels, the study consisted of two conditions. In the monetary condition, (n = 15) participants were informed at the start of the study that they would receive their final score in £ at the end of the study. In the reputation condition, (n = 15) participants were informed that the points would be inputted on to a scoreboard and distributed around the local basketball clubs and in the league newsletter. \n\nThroughout each trial, participants' heart rate variability (HRV) was measured via a chest strap. HRV is considered to be indirectly related to levels of stress (i.e., higher HRV = less stress).\n\nThe data is in stored in two separate files.  \n\n1. Information on the conditions for each trial for each participant is stored in __.csv__ format at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/basketballconditions.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/basketballconditions.csv).  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|variable  |description                                                                                     |\n|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|stakes    |Number of points available to be won/lost based on successful completion of     trial           |\n|condition |Whether the final score will be converted to £ or will be placed on a public       leader-board |\n|sub       |Participant Identifier                                                                          |\n|throw     |Whether the participant successfully threw the ball in the   basket                             |\n|trial_no  |Trial number (1 to 20                                                                           |\n:::\n:::\n\n2.
