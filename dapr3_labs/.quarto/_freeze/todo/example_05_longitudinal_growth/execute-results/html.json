Each document is structured in the same way:  \n\n  - First the data is introduced. For the purpose of these tutorials, I will only use examples where the data can be shared - either because it is from an open access publication, or because it is unpublished or simulated. \n  - Second, the structure of the data is discussed so that we can more easily see what data structure the design creates, and how this aligns to the variables in the data.\n  - Third, we translate the research questions into formal equations, and then `lmer()` code. \n  - Finally, we will follow those through for our example data.\n\n:::\n\n# Overview\n\n# Data Wrangling\n\n# Descriptives\n\n# Visualisations\n\n# Analysis\n## Equations\n\n## Fitting the models\n\n# Check model\n\n# Visualise model\n\n# Interpret Model",
