In that example researchers had collected data from 32 residents of Edinburgh & Lothians.  \n\nResearchers want to study this relationship across all of Scotland. They contact all the Local Authority Areas (LAAs) and ask them to collect data for them for them, with participants completing the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being, and being asked to estimate the average number of hours they spend outdoors each week.  \n\nTwenty of the Local Authority Areas provided data. It is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv), and you can read it into your R environment using the code below: \n```{r eval=FALSE}\nscotmw <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv\")\n```\nThe dataset contains information on 132 participants.

But is this a reasonable assumption that we can make? Might we not think that the residents of the highlands might have generally higher levels of wellbeing than those living in Glasgow? Additionally, the association between outdoor time and wellbeing might be different depending on where you live?  \n\nThe natural grouping of the people into their respective geographic area introduces a level of *dependence* which we would be best to account for.  \n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(\"2\")`\nTry running the code below.  \n```{r eval=FALSE}\nggplot(data = scotmw, aes(x = outdoor_time, y = wellbeing))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=FALSE)\n```\nThen try editing the code to include an aesthetic mapping from the LAA to the color in the plot.  \n\nHow do your thoughts about the relationship between outdoor time and wellbeing change?\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = scotmw, aes(x = outdoor_time, y = wellbeing))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=FALSE)\n```\n\n```{r}\nggplot(data = scotmw, aes(x = outdoor_time, y = wellbeing, col = laa))+\n  geom_point()+\n  geom_smooth(method=\"lm\",se=FALSE)\n```\n  \nFrom the second plot, we see a lot of the LAA appear to have a positive relationship (outdoor time is associated with higher wellbeing). There seem to be differences between LAAs in both the general wellbeing level (residents of Na h-Eileanan Siar  - the outer hebrides - have high wellbeing), and in how outdoor time is associated with wellbeing (for instance, outdoor time doesn't seem to help in Glasgow City).  \n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n# Complete pooling, No pooling\n\n:::frame\n**Complete Pooling**  \n\nWe can consider the simple regression model (`lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time, data = scotmw)`) to \"pool\" the information from all observations together. In this 'Complete Pooling' approach, we simply ignore the natural clustering of the people into their local authority areas, as if we were unaware of it. The problem is that this assumes the same regression line for all local authority areas, which might not be that appropriate. Additionally, we violate the assumption that our residuals are independent, because all of the residuals from certain groups will be more like one another than they are to the others.  \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=\"350px\", fig.align=\"center\", fig.cap=\"Complete pooling can lead to bad fit for certain groups\"}\nggplot(data = scotmw, aes(x = outdoor_time, y = wellbeing))+\n  geom_point(size=3, alpha=.1)+\n  geom_abline(intercept = coef(simplemod)[1], slope = coef(simplemod)[2], lwd=2)+\n  geom_text(inherit.aes=F,x=4.5,y=8, label=\"Complete Pooling Line\")+\n  theme(text=element_text(size=21))+\n  geom_point(data = filter(scotmw, str_detect(laa, \"Eileanan|Glasgow\")), size=3, aes(col=laa))\n```\n\n:::\n\n:::frame  \n**No Pooling**  \n\nThere are various ways we could attempt to deal with the problem that our data are in groups (or \"clusters\"). With the tools you have learned in DAPR2, you may be tempted to try including LAA in the model as another predictor, to allow for some local authority areas being generally better than others:\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + laa, data = scotmw)\n```\nOr even to include an interaction to allow for local authority areas to show different patterns of association between outdoor time and wellbeing:\n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time * laa, data = scotmw)\n```\n\nThis approach gets termed the \"No Pooling\" method, because the information from each cluster contributes *only* to an estimated parameter for that cluster, and there is no pooling of information across clusters. This is a good start, but it means that a) we are estimating *a lot* of parameters, and b) we are not necessarily estimating the parameter of interest (the *overall* effect of practice on reading age). Furthermore, we'll probably end up having high variance in the estimates at each group.  \n\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(\"3\")`\nFit a linear model which accounts for the grouping of participants into their different local authorities, but holds the association between outdoor time and wellbeing as constant across LAAs:\n```{r}\nmod1 <- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + laa, data = scotmw)\n```\n\nCan you construct a plot of the **fitted** values from this model, coloured by LAA?  \n(Hint: you might want to use the `augment()` function from the **broom** package)\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(broom)\naugment(mod1) %>%\n  ggplot(.,aes(x=outdoor_time, y=.fitted, col=laa))+\n  geom_line()\n```\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(\"4\")`\nWhat happens (to the plot, and to your parameter estimates) when you include the interaction between `laa` and `outdoor_time`?\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nmod2 <- lm(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time * laa, data = scotmw)\n\nbroom::augment(mod2) %>%\n  ggplot(.,aes(x=outdoor_time, y=.fitted, col=laa))+\n  geom_line()\n```\nWe can see now that our model is fitting a different relationship between wellbeing and outdoor time for each LAA. This is good - we're going to get better estimates for different LAAs (e.g. wellbeing of residents of the Highlands increases with more outdoor time, and wellbeing of residents of Glasgow does not).  \n\nWe can see that this model provides a better fit - it results in a significant reduction in the residual sums of squares:\n```{r}\nanova(mod1, mod2)\n```\n\nBut accounting for this heterogeneity over clusters in the effect of interest comes at the expense of not pooling information across groups to get one estimate for \"**the** association between outdoor time and wellbeing\". Additionally, these models will tend to have low statistical power because they are using fewer observations (only those within each cluster) to estimate parameters which only represent within-cluster effects.  \n`r solend()`\n\n\n# Some Data Wrangling\n\nWith more complex data structures comes more in-depth data wrangling in order to get it ready for fitting and estimating our model. Typically, the data we get will not be neat and tidy, and will come in different formats. Often we simply get whatever our experiment/questionnaire software spits out, and we have to work from there. When you are designing a study, you can do work on the front end to minimise the data-wrangling. Try to design an experiment/questionnaire while keeping in mind what the data comes out looking like.  \n\nBelow we have some data from a fake experiment. We've tried to make it a bit more difficult to work with - a bit more similar to what we would _actually_ get when doing real-life research.   \n\n:::frame\n**Data: Raising the stakes**\n\nThis data is from a simulated study that aims to investigate how levels of stress are influenced by the size and type of potential rewards. \n\n30 volunteers from an amateur basketball league participated. Each participant completed 20 trials in which they were tasked with throwing a basketball and scoring a goal in order to score points. The number of points up for grabs varied between trials, ranging from 1 to 20 points, with the order randomised for each participant. If a participant successfully threw the ball in the basket, then their score increased accordingly. If they missed, their score decreased accordingly. Participants were informed of the number of points available prior to each throw.  \n\nTo examine the influence of the *type* of reward/loss on stress-levels, the study consisted of two conditions. In the monetary condition, (n = 15) participants were informed at the start of the study that they would receive their final score in £ at the end of the study. In the reputation condition, (n = 15) participants were informed that the points would be inputted on to a scoreboard and distributed around the local basketball clubs and in the league newsletter. \n\nThroughout each trial, participants' heart rate variability (HRV) was measured via a chest strap. HRV is considered to be indirectly related to levels of stress (i.e., higher HRV = less stress).\n\nThe data is in stored in two separate files.  \n\n1. Information on the conditions for each trial for each participant is stored in __.csv__ format at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/basketballconditions.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/basketballconditions.csv).  \n```{r echo=FALSE}\nbball <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/basketballconditions.csv\")\ntibble(\n  variable = names(bball),\n  description = c(\"Number of points available to be won/lost based on successful completion of     trial\",\"Whether the final score will be converted to £ or will be placed on a public       leader-board\",\"Participant Identifier\",\"Whether the participant successfully threw the ball in the   basket\", \"Trial number (1 to 20\")\n) %>% knitr::kable()\n```\n2. Information on participants' HRV for each trial is stored in **.xlsx** format, and can be downloaded from [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/basketballhrv.xlsx](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/basketballhrv.xlsx). \n```{r echo=FALSE}\nbballhrv <- readxl::read_xlsx(\"baskeballhrvdata.xlsx\")\ntibble(\n  variable = c(names(bballhrv)[1:4],\"...\"),\n  description = c(\"Subject Identifier\",paste0(\"HRV average during trial \",c(1,2,3,\"...\")))\n) %>% knitr::kable()\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(\"5\")`\nGet the data into your R session. \n\n__Note:__ For one of the files, this is a bit different to how we have given you data in previous exercises.

When we make data longer, we're essentially making lots of columns into 2 longer columns. Above, in the animation, the wide variable **x**, **y** and **z** go into a new longer column called **name** that specifies which (x/y/z) it came from, and the values get put into the **val** column.  \n\nThe animation takes a shortcut in the code it displays above, but you could also use `pivot_longer(c(x,y,z), names_to = \"name\", values_to = \"val\")`. To reverse this, and put it back to being wide, we tell R which columns to take the names and values *from*: `pivot_wider(names_from = name, values_from = val)`.  \n:::\n\nNow comes a fun bit. \nYou may have noticed that we have two datasets for this study. If we are interested in relationships between the heart rate variability (HRV) of participants during each trial, as well as the experimental manipulations (i.e., the condition of each trial), these are currently in different datasets.  \nSolution: we need to join them together!  \n\nProvided that both data-sets contain information on participant number and trial number, which uniquely identify each observation, we can join them together matching on those variables!  \n\n`r qbegin(\"7\")`\nJoin the two datasets (both in long format) together. \n\nNote that the variables we are matching on need to have the information in the same format. For instance, R won't be able to match `\"trial_1\",\"trial_2\",\"trial_3\"` with `1, 2, 3` because they are different things. We would need to edit one of them to be in the same format.  \n\n**Hint:** You should end up with 600 rows.  \n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nbball <- full_join(bball, bballhrv)\nhead(bball)\n```\n`r solend()`\n\n:::rtip\n__Joining data__\n\nThere are lots of different ways to join data-sets, depending on whether we want to keep rows from one data-set or the other, or keep only those in both data-sets etc. \n\n```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Check out the help documentation for them all using `?full_join`.\"}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/messy/joins.png\")\n```\n\n:::\n\n# Exploring Clustering\n\n`r qbegin(\"8\")`\nContinuing with our basketball/hrv study, consider the following questions:  \n  \nWhat are the units of observations?  \nWhat are the groups/clusters?  \nWhat varies *within* these clusters?  \nWhat varies *between* these clusters?  \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\nWhat are the units of observations? __trials__  \nWhat are the groups/clusters? __participants__\nWhat varies *within* these clusters? __size of reward__    \nWhat varies *between* these clusters? __type of reward__  \n\n`r solend()`\n\n`r qbegin(\"9\")`\nCalculate the ICC, using the `ICCbare()` function from the **ICC** package.  \n\nRemember, you can look up the help for a function by typing a `?` followed by the function name in the console. \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nlibrary(ICC)\nICCbare(x = sub, y = hrv, data = bball)\n```\n`r solend()`\n\n:::statbox\n\n**Understanding ICC a bit better**  \n  \nThink about what ICC represents - the ratio of the variance between the groups to the total variance.  \nYou can think of the \"variance between the groups\" as the group means varying around the overall mean (the black dots around the black line), and the total variance as that plus the addition of the variance of the individual observations around each group mean (each set of coloured points around their respective larger black dot):\n```{r}\nggplot(bball, aes(x=sub, y=hrv))+\n  geom_point(aes(col=sub),alpha=.3)+\n  stat_summary(geom = \"pointrange\")+\n  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(bball$hrv))+\n  guides(col=FALSE)\n```\n\nYou can also think of the ICC as the correlation between two randomly drawn observations from the same group. \nThis is a bit of a tricky thing to get your head round if you try to relate it to the type of \"correlation\" that you are familiar with. Pearson's correlation (e.g think about a typical scatterplot) operates on *pairs of observations* (a set of values on the x-axis and their corresponding values on the y-axis), whereas ICC operates on *data which is structured in groups*.  \n  \n`r optbegin(\"Optional - ICC as the expected correlation between two observations from same group\", olabel=F)`\n\nLet's suppose we had only 2 observations in each group.  \n```{r echo=FALSE}\ntempdat <- read.csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/iccexplainer.csv\")\nhead(tempdat) %>% rbind(.,rep(\"...\", 3))\n```\n\n```{r include=F}\nlibrary(nlme)\nres <- lme(y ~ 1, random = ~ 1 | cluster, data=tempdat, method=\"ML\")\nic <- getVarCov(res)[1] / (getVarCov(res)[1] + res$sigma^2)\n```\nThe ICC for this data is `r round(ic,2)`:\n\nNow suppose we *reshape* our data so that we have one row per group, and one column for each observation to look like this:\n```{r echo=F}\ntempdat_wide <- tempdat %>% \n  pivot_wider(names_from=observation, values_from=y, names_prefix = \"obs\") \ntempdat_wide %>% head %>% rbind(.,rep(\"...\", 3))\n```\nCalculating Pearson's correlation on those two columns yields `r cor(tempdat_wide$obs1, tempdat_wide$obs2) %>% round(.,2)`, which isn't quite right.

It still mentions something about the grouping. \n```{r}\nbball <- bball %>% mutate(\n    grand_mean = mean(hrv)\n  ) %>% \n  group_by(sub) %>%\n  mutate(\n    group_mean = mean(hrv)\n  )\n\nclass(bball)\n```\n\nTo remove the grouping, we can use `ungroup()` (we could also just add this to the end of our code sequence above and re-run it):\n\n```{r}\nbball <- ungroup(bball)\nclass(bball)\n```\n\n:::\n\nNow we need to create a column which is the squared differences between the observations $y_{ij}$ and the group means $\\bar{y_i}$.  \nWe also want a column which is the squared differences between the group means $\\bar{y_i}$ and the overall mean $\\bar{y}$.  \n```{r}\nbball <- bball %>% \n  mutate(\n    within = (hrv-group_mean)^2,\n    between = (group_mean-grand_mean)^2\n  )\n```\n\nAnd then we want to sum them:\n```{r}\nssbetween = sum(bball$between)\nsswithin = sum(bball$within)\n```\n\nFinally, we divide them by the degrees of freedom. \n```{r}\n# Mean Squares between\nmsb = ssbetween / (30-1)\n# Mean Squares within \nmse = sswithin / (600-30)\n```\n\nAnd calculate the ICC!!!\n```{r}\n# ICC\n(msb-mse) /(msb + (19*mse))\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(\"10\")`\n> How do the size and type of potential reward/loss interact to influence levels of stress? \n\nUsing `lm()`, we might fit the following model to investigate the research question above. \n```{r}\n#| eval: false\nlm(hrv ~ stakes*condition, data = bball)\n```\n\nHowever, we know that this simply ignores that our observations are not independent - we have repeated measures from the same individuals. Given that roughly 30% of the variation in HRV can be attributed to variability between participants (as found when we calculated ICC), we don't want to mis-attribute this to differences between experimental conditions.  \n\nUsing the \"no pooling\" method (i.e., including participant as a fixed effect), becomes difficult because the `sub` variable (the participant id variable) also uniquely identifies the two conditions. Note that if we fit the following model, some coefficients are not defined.  \nTry it and see:  \n```{r eval=FALSE}\nlm(hrv ~ stakes*sub + stakes*condition, data=bball)\n```\n\nThis sort of perfectly balanced design has traditionally been approached with extensions of ANOVA (\"repeated measures ANOVA\", \"mixed ANOVA\"). These methods can partition out variance due to one level of clustering (e.g. subjects), and can examine factorial designs when one factor is within cluster, and the other is between. You can see an example [here](example_00_anova.html) if you are interested. However, ANOVA has a lot of constraints - it can't handle multiple levels of clustering (e.g. children in classes in schools), it will likely require treating variables such as time as a factor, and it's not great with missing data.  \nThe multi-level model (MLM) provides a more flexible framework, and this is what we will begin to look at next week.  \n\n`r qend()`\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"include-in-header":["assets/toggling.html"],"number-sections":false,"output-file":"01_regressionrefresh.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.587","toc_float":true,"theme":["united","assets/style-labs.scss"],"code-copy":false,"title":"Regression Refresh and Clustered Data","link-citations":"yes","params":{"SHOW_SOLS":true,"TOGGLE":true},"editor_options":{"chunk_output_type":"console"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
