This often fits with the name \"mixed effects\" for these models:\n\n$$\n\\color{red}{y_{ij}}\\color{black} = (\\color{blue}{\\beta_0}\\color{black} + \\color{orange}{\\zeta_{0i}}\\color{black}) \\cdot 1 + ( \\color{blue}{\\beta_{1}}\\color{black} + \\color{orange}{\\zeta_{1i}} \\color{black}) \\cdot x_{ij}  +  \\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\\n$$\n\nAnd then we also have the condensed matrix form of the model, in which the Z matrix represents the grouping structure, and the $u$ (or $\\zeta$) are the estimated random deviations. \n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\boldsymbol{X\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{Zu} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}\n$$\n`r optend()`\n\n:::\n\n# Fitting Multilevel Models\n\n## Introducing **lme4** \n\n:::rtip\n\nWe're going to use the `lme4` package, and specifically the functions `lmer()` and `glmer()`.  \n\"(g)lmer\" here stands for \"(generalised) linear mixed effects regression\". \n\nYou will have seen some use of these functions in the lectures. The broad syntax is:  \n<br>\n<div style=\"margin-left:50px;\">**lmer(*formula*, REML = *logical*, data = *dataframe*)**</div>    \n<br>\n\nWe write the first bit of our **formula** just the same as our old friend the normal linear model `y ~ 1 + x + x2 + ...`, where `y` is the name of our outcome variable, `1` is the intercept (which we don't have to explicitly state as it will be included anyway) and `x`, `x2` etc are the names of our explanatory variables.  \n\nWith **lme4**, we now have the addition of __random effect terms)), specified in parenthesis with the `|` operator (the vertical line | is often found to the left of the z key on QWERTY keyboards).  \nWe use the `|` operator to separate the parameters (intercept, slope etc.) on the LHS, from the grouping variable(s) on the RHS, by which we would like to model these parameters as varying.  \n\n__Random Intercept__  \nLet us suppose that we wish to model our intercept not as a fixed constant, but as varying randomly according to some grouping around a fixed center. \nWe can such a model by allowing the intercept to vary by our grouping variable (`g` below): \n\n:::statbox\n<center>`lmer(y ~ 1 + x + (1|g), data = df)`</center>\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Level 1:} \\\\\n& \\color{red}{Y_{ij}} = \\color{blue}{\\beta_{0i} \\cdot 1 + \\beta_{1} \\cdot X_{ij}} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\\n& \\text{Level 2:} \\\\\n& \\color{blue}{\\beta_{0i}} = \\gamma_{00} + \\color{orange}{\\zeta_{0i}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n:::\n\n\n\n\n__Random Slope__  \nBy extension we can also allow the effect `y~x` to vary between groups, by including the `x` on the left hand side of `|` in the random effects part of the call to `lmer()`.\n\n:::statbox\n<center>`lmer(y ~ 1 + x + (1 + x |g), data = df)`</center>\n$$\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{Level 1:} \\\\\n& \\color{red}{y_{ij}} = \\color{blue}{\\beta_{0i} \\cdot 1 + \\beta_{1i} \\cdot x_{ij}} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\\n& \\text{Level 2:} \\\\\n& \\color{blue}{\\beta_{0i}} = \\gamma_{00} + \\color{orange}{\\zeta_{0i}} \\\\\n& \\color{blue}{\\beta_{1i}} = \\gamma_{10} + \\color{orange}{\\zeta_{1i}} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Estimation\n\n### Maximum Likelihood (ML)  \n\nRemember back to DAPR2 when we introduced logistic regression, and we briefly discussed **Maximum likelihood** in an explanation of how models are fitted.  \n\nThe key idea of *maximum likelihood estimation* (MLE) is that we (well, the computer) iteratively finds the set of estimates for our model which it considers to best reproduce our observed data. Recall our simple linear regression model of how time spent outdoors (hrs per week) is associated with mental wellbeing: \n$$\n\\color{red}{Wellbeing_i} = \\color{blue}{\\beta_0 \\cdot{} 1 + \\beta_1 \\cdot{} OutdoorTime_{i}} + \\varepsilon_i\n$$\nThere are values of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ and $\\sigma_\\varepsilon$ which maximise the probability of observing the data that we have. For linear regression, these we obtained these same values a different way, via minimising the sums of squares. And we saw that this is not possible for more complex models (e.g., logistic), which is where we turn to MLE.  \n\n:::statbox\nTo read about the subtle difference between \"likelihood\" and \"probability\", you can find a short explanation [here](./lvp.html){target=\"_blank\"}\n:::\n\nIf we are estimating just one single parameter (e.g. a mean), then we can imagine the process of *maximum likelihood estimation* in a one-dimensional world - simply finding the top of the curve: \n```{r}\n#| label: fig-mle\n#| echo: false\n#| out.width: \"350px\"\n#| fig-cap: \"MLE\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/intro/mle.png\")\n```\nHowever, our typical models estimate a whole bunch of parameters. The simple regression model above is already having to estimate $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$ and $\\sigma_\\varepsilon$, and our multi-level models have far more! With lots of parameters being estimated and all interacting to influence the likelihood, our nice curved line becomes a complex surface (see Left panel of @fig-multisurf). So what we (our computers) need to do is find the maximum, but avoid local maxima and singularities (see @fig-maxima). \n```{r}\n#| label: fig-multisurf\n#| echo: false\n#| out.width: \"49%\" \n#| fig-cap: \"MLE for a more complex model\"\n#| fig-align: 'center'\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/multisurftb.png\")\n```\n\n### Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML)\n\nWhen it comes to estimating multilevel models, maximum likelihood will consider the fixed effects as unknown values in its estimation of the variance components (the random effect variances). This leads to biased estimates of the variance components, specifically biasing them toward being too small, especially if $n_\\textrm{clusters} - n_\\textrm{level 2 predictors} - 1 < 50$. Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML), however, separates the estimation of fixed and random parts of the model, leading to unbiased estimates of the variance components.  \n\n:::rtip\n`lmer()` models are by default fitted with REML. This is better for small samples. \n:::\n\n\n:::sticky\n__Model Comparisons in MLM__\n\nWhen we compare models that differ in their fixed effects via comparing model deviance (e.g. the likelihood ratio), REML should __not__ be used as only the variance components are included in the likelihood. Functions like `anova()` will automatically refit your models with `ML` for you, but it is worth checking.   \n  \nWe __cannot__ compare (either with ML or REML) models that differ in both the fixed and random parts. \n\n:::\n\n\n### Model Convergence\n\nFor large datasets and/or complex models (lots of random-effects terms), it is quite common to get a *convergence warning*.  There are lots of different ways to [deal with these](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/33653_57fc7b8e5d484c909b615d8633c01d51.html) (to try to rule out hypotheses about what is causing them).  \n\nFor now, if `lmer()` gives you convergence errors, you could try changing the optimizer. Bobyqa is a good one: add `control = lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\")` when you run your model.  \n\n```{r eval=F}\nlmer(y ~ 1 + x1 + ... + (1 + .... | g), data = df, \n     control = lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\n```\n\n`r optbegin(\"What *is* a convergence warning??\", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nThere are different techniques for maximum likelihood estimation, which we apply by using different 'optimisers'. Technical problems to do with **model convergence** and **'singular fit'** come into play when the optimiser we are using either can't find a suitable maximum, or gets stuck in a singularity (think of it like a black hole of likelihood, which signifies that there is not enough variation in our data to construct such a complex model).  \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-maxima\n#| echo: false\n#| out.width: \"49%\"\n#| fig-cap: \"local/global maxima and singularities\"\n#| fig-align: \"center\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/intro/mle2.png\")\n```\n\n`r optend()`\n\n# Exercises: Intro MLM\n\n## Cross-Sectional: Wellbeing Across Scotland\n\n:::frame\nRecall our dataset from last week, in which we used linear regression to determine how outdoor time (hours per week) is associated with wellbeing in different local authority areas (LAAs) of Scotland. We have data from various LAAs, from Glasgow City, to the Highlands.  \n\n```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nscotmw <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv\")\n```\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(gt)\nscotmw <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv\")\ntibble(variable=names(scotmw),\n       description=c(\"Participant ID\",\"Participant Name\",\"Local Authority Area\",\"Self report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors\",\"Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being.

Would we like our models to accommodate individuals to vary in their overall wellbeing, to vary in how they change in wellbeing over the course of the assessment period, or both?\n\nTo investigate whether wellbeing changed over the course of the assessments, or whether it stayed the same, we could fit and compare 2 models:  \n\n1. The \"null\" or \"intercept-only\" model. \n2. A model with wellbeing predicted by time point.  \n\nAnd we can then compare them in terms of model fit. As discussed in the lecture, there are lots of ways to assess inference in multilevel models. \n\nOur sample size here (180 participants, each with 4 observations) is reasonably large given the relative simplicity of our model. We might consider running a straightforward Likelihood Ratio Test using `anova(restricted_model, full_model)` to compare our two models. \n\n:::hints\n- **Remember, we shouldn't compare models with different random effect structures.**  \n- *(For now, don't worry too much about \"singular fits\".

That makes very little sense. What it is actually fitting is a model where there is assumed to be __no overall effect__ of TimePoint.

Using the **effects** package, does this help: `as.data.frame(effect(\"TimePoint:Condition\", model))`  \n  2. Using `fitted(model)`\n  3. Using `augment()` from the **broom.mixed** package.  \n  4. **sjPlot**, as we used in DAPR2\n:::\n\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nround(coef(summary(m.full)), 3)\n```\n\n* `(Intercept)` ==> Wellbeing at baseline in 'control' group\n* `TimePoint`  ==> Slope of welleing change in 'control' group\n* `Conditionunlimited_leave` ==> baseline wellbeing difference from 'unlimited_leave' group relative to 'control' group\n* `Conditionfourday_week` ==> baseline wellbeing difference from 'fourday_week' group relative to 'control' group\n* `TimePoint:Conditionunlimited_leave`  ==> slope of wellbeing change in 'unlimited_leave' group relative to 'control' group\n* `TimePoint:Conditionfourday_week`  ==> slope of wellbeing change in 'fourday_week' group relative to 'control' group\n\n:::int\nCompared to the control group, wellbeing increased by 1.35 points/year more for employees with unlimited leave, and by 2.28 points/year for employees on the 4 day week.  \n:::\n\nTo visualise the model fitted values and observed data, there are various options to choose from. \n\n1. Using the `effect()` function (and then adding the means and SEs from the original data):  \n```{r}\nef <- as.data.frame(effect(\"TimePoint:Condition\", m.full))\n\nggplot(ef, aes(TimePoint, fit, color=Condition)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  stat_summary(data=wellbeingwork3, aes(y=Wellbeing), \n               fun.data=mean_se, geom=\"pointrange\", size=1) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n2. Using the `fitted()` function to extract and plot fitted values from the model: \n\n```{r}\nggplot(wellbeingwork3, aes(TimePoint, Wellbeing, color=Condition)) + \n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom=\"pointrange\", size=1) + \n  stat_summary(aes(y=fitted(m.full)), fun=mean, geom=\"line\") + \n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n3. Or using `augment()`:\n```{r}\naugment(m.full) %>%\nggplot(., aes(TimePoint, Wellbeing, color=Condition)) + \n  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom=\"pointrange\", size=1) + \n  stat_summary(aes(y=.fitted), fun=mean, geom=\"line\") + \n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n4. finally, __sjPlot__ can give us the model fitted values, but it's trickier to add on the observed means. We can add the raw data using `show.data=TRUE`, but that will make it a bit messier\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nplot_model(m.full, type=\"int\")\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n## Repeated Measures: Basketball/HRV\n\nWhile the wellbeing example considers the groupings or 'clusters' of different LAAs, a more relate-able grouping in psychological research is that of several observations belonging to the same individual. One obvious benefit of this is that we can collect many more observations with fewer participants, and account for the resulting dependency of observations. \n\n:::frame\n\nRecall the data from the previous week, from an experiment in which heart rate variability (HRV) was measured for amateur basketball players when tasked with scoring a goal with varying levels and type of potential loss/reward.  \n\nA separate group of researchers conducted a replication of this experiment with 15 participants. There were some issues with the HRV measurements resulting in some missing data, and one participant being excluded completely (meaning a slightly unbalanced design in that 8 participants were in one condition and only 7 in the other).  \n\nYou can find the data at: [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/bball_replication.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/bball_replication.csv)\nIt contains the following variables:  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nbballrep <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/bball_replication.csv\")\ntibble(variable=names(bballrep),\n       description = c(\"Size of reward (points to be won/lost on a given trial). Ranges 1 to 20\", \n                       \"Experimental Condition: Whether the participant was playing for monetary reward ('money') or for a place on the scoreboard ('kudos')\",\n                       \"Participant Identifier\",\"Whether the participant successfully completed the trial\",\"Trial Number (1 to 20)\",\"Average Heart Rate Variability over the 10 seconds prior to throwing\")\n) %>% gt()\n```\n\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(\"9\")`\nRecall that the research question was concerned with how the size and type of potential reward influence stress levels (as measured by heart rate variability):\n\n> How do the size and type of potential reward/loss interact to influence levels of stress? \n\nFit a multi-level model to examine the effects of size and type of reward on HRV, and their interaction. \n\n:::hints\n\nRemember to think about:  \n\n- what is our outcome variable of interest?\n- what are our predictor variables that we are interested in?\n    - these should be in the fixed effects part.    \n- what is the clustering?\n    - this should be the random effects `(1 | cluster)` part\n- does size of reward (`stakes`) vary within clusters, or between?\n    - if so, we might be able to fit a random slope of `stakes | cluster`. if not, then it doesn't make sense to do so.  \n- does type of reward (`condition`) vary within clusters, or between?\n      - if so, we might be able to fit a random slope of `condition | cluster`. if not, then it doesn't make sense to do so. \n\n\n_If you get an error about model convergence, consider changing the optimiser (see [above](02_intromlm.html#Estimation))_\n\n:::\n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n\n```{r}\nmod <- lmer(hrv ~ stakes * condition + \n              (1 + stakes | sub), data = bballrep,\n            control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))\nsummary(mod)\n```\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\nWe now have a model, but we don't have any p-values, confidence intervals, or inferential criteria on which to draw conclusions.  \n\nIn the longitudinal study of wellbeing over time, we did a series of model comparisons, performing tests of the incremental inclusion of additional parameters. In the Basketball/HRV example we went straight for the full model. This is in part because the two research aims of the longitudinal example can be matched two models (one for the \"overall\" trajectory, and one looking at differences between groups), whereas the Basketball/HRV research question simply is interested in the theorised `stakes*condition` interaction.  \n\nThere are some options here for us to choose from for this model: we can either perform tests against the null that certain parameter estimates are equal to zero (i.e. testing that the interaction is zero), or ca wen fit a reduced model and conduct model comparisons between that and the full model (thereby isolating and testing the improvement in the model due to including the interaction term).  \nThere are different methods of implementing these in R, as detailed in the table below. Standard likelihood ratio tests require models to be fitted with ML, and can be less reliable when samples are small (at any level). Often, approximations of the degrees of freedom are preferable, in part because these allow models to be fitted with REML. The more computationally expensive bootstrapping approach is perhaps the most recommended approach as it can provide more accurate p-values for the likelihood ratio test, as well as confidence intervals for our estimates, but for larger models it can take a lot of time to compute. Additionally, when performing the bootstrap it is important to watch out for issues with convergence in the bootstrap iterations - it may indicate your model needs simplification.  \n\nMethod |  Model Comparison |  Parameter Estimation|\n|------:|--------:|------------:|\n| Approximations to $ddf$ | Kenward-Rogers: `KRmodcomp(model2, model1)` from the __pbkrtest__ package  | Satterthwaite: load the __lmerTest__ package and re-fit your model (the summary output will then have p-values)  |\n| Likelihood Ratio Test | `anova(model1, model2)` |  |\n| Parametric Bootstrap | `PBmodcomp(model2, model1)` from the __pbkrtest__ package | `confint(model, method=\"boot\")`|\n\n\n`r qbegin(\"10\")`\nThis study is interested in whether the previously reported interaction between size (`stakes`) and type (`condition)` of reward on stress levels - measured by heart-rate variability (`hrv`) - replicates in their new sample.  \n\nPick a method of your choosing and perform a test of/provide an interval for the relevant effect of interest.  \n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\nIn this case we have $n=15$ participants (our level 2 sample size), and each participant has approximately 20 observations (but some have missingness). The sample size might be a bit small for standard likelihood ratio tests (i.e. comparing models fitted with ML rather than REML). We would be better off using models fitted with REML because they will provide more accurate estimates of the variance components (the `1+stakes|sub` bit), and so better estimates of the standard errors of the fixed effects. \n\nWe'll go through each approach here so you can see what it looks like. There's no *right* answer here.  \n\n__Standard LRT__  \n\nIf we choose a model comparison approach, we need to isolate the interaction term, because that's what we're interested in: \n```{r}\nmod_res <- lmer(hrv ~ stakes + condition + (1 + stakes | sub), data = bballrep,\n            control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))\nmod_full <- lmer(hrv ~ stakes * condition + (1 + stakes | sub), data = bballrep,\n            control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))\n```\n\nThis needs models fitted with ML rather than REML, but it will automatically re-fit them for you:\n```{r}\n#| message: true\n#| warning: true\nanova(mod_res, mod_full)\n```\n:::int\nInclusion of the interaction between size and type of reward was not found to improve model fit, as indicated by a likelihood ratio test ($\\chi^2(1) = 0.71, p = .399$). \n:::\n\n\n__df approximations__  \n\nIf instead we choose the approximation for degrees of freedom, then generally speaking the Kenward Rogers approach is preferable as it is a little more conservative.  \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(pbkrtest)\nKRmodcomp(mod_full, mod_res)\n```\n:::int\nInclusion of the interaction between size and type of reward was not found to improve model fit ($F(1, 13^*) = 0.63, p = .441$).  \n  \n$\\textrm{ }^*$: denominator degrees of freedom approximated using Kenward-Rogers method.  \n:::\n\nAlternatively, we can perform the tests on the fixed effects themselves. This is more like what you will remember from DAPR2, where we get a table of effects and we can interpret each one in turn. For now we'll just focus on the interaction term as that is the main one of interest.  \n\n```{r}\nlibrary(lmerTest)\nmod_full <- lmer(hrv ~ stakes * condition + (1 + stakes| sub), data = bballrep,\n            control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))\nsummary(mod_full)\n```\n:::int\nThere was no significant interaction between size and type of reward ($\\beta = -0.06, SE = 0.07, t(13.04^*) = -0.8, p = .441$). \n\n$\\textrm{ }^*$: denominator degrees of freedom approximated using Satterthwaite method.  \n:::\n\n__parametric bootstrapping__  \n\nWe could instead perform the parametric bootstrap for the likelihood ratio test instead. This requires us to remove any incomplete cases from the dataset first, and then re-fit the models.  \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nset.seed(993)\n```\n\nThis will _also_ (just like the standard LRT) refit the models for us with ML rather than REML (it just won't tell us that it's doing so!) \n```{r}\nlibrary(pbkrtest)\nbballrep2 = na.omit(bballrep)\nmod_res <- lmer(hrv ~ stakes + condition + (1 + stakes | sub), data = bballrep2,\n            control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))\nmod_full <- lmer(hrv ~ stakes * condition + (1 + stakes | sub), data = bballrep2,\n            control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))\nPBmodcomp(mod_full, mod_res)\n```\n\n:::int\nInclusion of the interaction between size and type of reward was not found to improve model fit, as indicated by a parametric bootstrapped ($k=1000$) likelihood ratio test ($\\Delta 2loglik = 0.612, p = .469$). \n:::\n\nLastly, we could also opt to construct parametric bootstrapped confidence intervals around our fixed effect estimates: \n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nset.seed(993)\n```\n\n```{r}\nconfint(mod_full, method=\"boot\")\n```\n:::int\nThere was no significant interaction between size and type of reward ($\\beta = -0.06, \\text{ parametric bootstrapped 95\\% CI: } [-0.196, 0.068]$).  \n\n:::\n\n`r solend()`\n\n\n<div class=\"tocify-extend-page\" data-unique=\"tocify-extend-page\" style=\"height: 0;\"></div>"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"include-in-header":["assets/toggling.html"],"number-sections":false,"output-file":"02_intromlm.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.0.38","toc_float":true,"theme":["united","assets/style-labs.scss"],"code-copy":false,"title":"Multilevel Models","link-citations":"yes","params":{"SHOW_SOLS":true,"TOGGLE":true},"editor_options":{"chunk_output_type":"console"}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
