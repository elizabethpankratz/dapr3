**A Note on terminology**

The methods we're going to learn about in the first five weeks of this course are known by lots of different names: "multilevel models"; "hierarchical linear models"; "mixed-effect models"; "mixed models"; "nested data models"; "random coefficient models"; "random-effects models"; "random parameter models"... and so on).   

What the idea boils down to is that **model parameters vary at more than one level.** This week, we're going to explore what that means.  

Throughout this course, we will tend to use the terms "mixed effect model", "linear mixed model (LMM)" and "multilevel model (MLM)" interchangeably.

# Introducing Multilevel Models

:::yellow 

Multilevel Models (MLMs) (or "Linear Mixed Models" (LMMs)) take the approach of allowing the groups/clusters to vary around our $\beta$ estimates. 

In the lectures, we saw this as:

$$
\begin{align}
& \text{for observation }j\text{ in group }i \\
\quad \\
& \text{Level 1:} \\
& \color{red}{y_{ij}}\color{black} = \color{blue}{\beta_{0i} \cdot 1 + \beta_{1i} \cdot x_{ij}}\color{black} + \varepsilon_{ij} \\
& \text{Level 2:} \\
& \color{blue}{\beta_{0i}}\color{black} = \gamma_{00} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}} \\
& \color{blue}{\beta_{1i}}\color{black} = \gamma_{10} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{1i}} \\
\quad \\
& \text{Where:} \\
& \gamma_{00}\text{ is the population intercept, and }\color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}}\color{black}\text{ is the deviation of group }i\text{ from }\gamma_{00} \\
& \gamma_{10}\text{ is the population slope, and }\color{orange}{\zeta_{1i}}\color{black}\text{ is the deviation of group }i\text{ from }\gamma_{10} \\
\end{align}
$$

We are now assuming $\color{orange}{\zeta_0}$, $\color{orange}{\zeta_1}$, and $\varepsilon$ to be normally distributed with a mean of 0, and we denote their variances as $\sigma_{\color{orange}{\zeta_0}}^2$, $\sigma_{\color{orange}{\zeta_1}}^2$, $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$ respectively. 

The $\color{orange}{\zeta}$ components also get termed the "random effects" part of the model, Hence names like "random effects model", etc. 

`r optbegin("Alternative notation", toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Many people use the symbol $u$ in place of $\zeta$.  
In various resources, you are likely to see $\alpha$ used to denote the intercept instead of $\beta_0$.  

Sometimes, you will see the levels collapsed into one equation, as it might make for more intuitive reading. This often fits with the name "mixed effects" for these models:

$$
\color{red}{y_{ij}}\color{black} = (\color{blue}{\beta_0}\color{black} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}}\color{black}) \cdot 1 + ( \color{blue}{\beta_{1}}\color{black} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{1i}} \color{black}) \cdot x_{ij}  +  \varepsilon_{ij} \\
$$

And then we also have the condensed matrix form of the model, in which the Z matrix represents the grouping structure, and the $u$ (or $\zeta$) are the estimated random deviations. 
$$
\mathbf{y} = \boldsymbol{X\beta} + \boldsymbol{Zu} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}
$$

# Fitting Multilevel Models

## Introducing **lme4** 

:::rtip

We're going to use the `lme4` package, and specifically the functions `lmer()` and `glmer()`.  
"(g)lmer" here stands for "(generalised) linear mixed effects regression". 

You will have seen some use of these functions in the lectures. The broad syntax is:  
<br>
<div style="margin-left:50px;">**lmer(*formula*, REML = *logical*, data = *dataframe*)**</div>    
<br>

We write the first bit of our **formula** just the same as our old friend the normal linear model `y ~ 1 + x + x2 + ...`, where `y` is the name of our outcome variable, `1` is the intercept (which we don't have to explicitly state as it will be included anyway) and `x`, `x2` etc are the names of our explanatory variables.  

With **lme4**, we now have the addition of __random effect terms)), specified in parenthesis with the `|` operator (the vertical line | is often found to the left of the z key on QWERTY keyboards).  
We use the `|` operator to separate the parameters (intercept, slope etc.) on the LHS, from the grouping variable(s) on the RHS, by which we would like to model these parameters as varying.  

__Random Intercept__  
Let us suppose that we wish to model our intercept not as a fixed constant, but as varying randomly according to some grouping around a fixed center. 
We can such a model by allowing the intercept to vary by our grouping variable (`g` below): 

:::statbox
<center>`lmer(y ~ 1 + x + (1|g), data = df)`</center>
$$
\begin{align}
& \text{Level 1:} \\
& \color{red}{Y_{ij}} = \color{blue}{\beta_{0i} \cdot 1 + \beta_{1} \cdot X_{ij}} + \varepsilon_{ij} \\
& \text{Level 2:} \\
& \color{blue}{\beta_{0i}} = \gamma_{00} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}} \\
\end{align}
$$
:::




__Random Slope__  
By extension we can also allow the effect `y~x` to vary between groups, by including the `x` on the left hand side of `|` in the random effects part of the call to `lmer()`.

:::statbox
<center>`lmer(y ~ 1 + x + (1 + x |g), data = df)`</center>
$$
\begin{align}
& \text{Level 1:} \\
& \color{red}{y_{ij}} = \color{blue}{\beta_{0i} \cdot 1 + \beta_{1i} \cdot x_{ij}} + \varepsilon_{ij} \\
& \text{Level 2:} \\
& \color{blue}{\beta_{0i}} = \gamma_{00} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}} \\
& \color{blue}{\beta_{1i}} = \gamma_{10} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{1i}} \\
\end{align}
$$

## Estimation

### Maximum Likelihood (ML)  

Remember back to DAPR2 when we introduced logistic regression, and we briefly discussed **Maximum likelihood** in an explanation of how models are fitted.  

The key idea of *maximum likelihood estimation* (MLE) is that we (well, the computer) iteratively finds the set of estimates for our model which it considers to best reproduce our observed data. Recall our simple linear regression model of how time spent outdoors (hrs per week) is associated with mental wellbeing: 
$$
\color{red}{Wellbeing_i} = \color{blue}{\beta_0 \cdot{} 1 + \beta_1 \cdot{} OutdoorTime_{i}} + \varepsilon_i
$$
There are values of $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ and $\sigma_\varepsilon$ which maximise the probability of observing the data that we have. For linear regression, these we obtained these same values a different way, via minimising the sums of squares. And we saw that this is not possible for more complex models (e.g., logistic), which is where we turn to MLE.  

:::statbox
To read about the subtle difference between "likelihood" and "probability", you can find a short explanation [here](./lvp.html){target="_blank"}
:::

If we are estimating just one single parameter (e.g. a mean), then we can imagine the process of *maximum likelihood estimation* in a one-dimensional world - simply finding the top of the curve: 
```{r}
#| label: fig-mle
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "350px"
#| fig-cap: "MLE"
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/mle.png")
```
However, our typical models estimate a whole bunch of parameters. The simple regression model above is already having to estimate $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$ and $\sigma_\varepsilon$, and our multi-level models have far more! With lots of parameters being estimated and all interacting to influence the likelihood, our nice curved line becomes a complex surface (see Left panel of @fig-multisurf). So what we (our computers) need to do is find the maximum, but avoid local maxima and singularities (see @fig-maxima). 
```{r}
#| label: fig-multisurf
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "49%" 
#| fig-cap: "MLE for a more complex model"
#| fig-align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics("images/multisurftb.png")
```

### Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML)

When it comes to estimating multilevel models, maximum likelihood will consider the fixed effects as unknown values in its estimation of the variance components (the random effect variances). This leads to biased estimates of the variance components, specifically biasing them toward being too small, especially if $n_\textrm{clusters} - n_\textrm{level 2 predictors} - 1 < 50$. Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML), however, separates the estimation of fixed and random parts of the model, leading to unbiased estimates of the variance components.  

:::rtip
`lmer()` models are by default fitted with REML. This is better for small samples. 
:::


:::sticky
__Model Comparisons in MLM__

When we compare models that differ in their fixed effects via comparing model deviance (e.g. the likelihood ratio), REML should __not__ be used as only the variance components are included in the likelihood. Functions like `anova()` will automatically refit your models with `ML` for you, but it is worth checking.   
  
We __cannot__ compare (either with ML or REML) models that differ in both the fixed and random parts. 

:::


### Model Convergence

For large datasets and/or complex models (lots of random-effects terms), it is quite common to get a *convergence warning*.  There are lots of different ways to [deal with these](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/33653_57fc7b8e5d484c909b615d8633c01d51.html) (to try to rule out hypotheses about what is causing them).  

For now, if `lmer()` gives you convergence errors, you could try changing the optimizer. Bobyqa is a good one: add `control = lmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa")` when you run your model.  

```{r eval=F}
lmer(y ~ 1 + x1 + ... + (1 + .... | g), data = df, 
     control = lmerControl(optimizer = "bobyqa"))
```

`r optbegin("What *is* a convergence warning??", olabel=FALSE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
There are different techniques for maximum likelihood estimation, which we apply by using different 'optimisers'. Technical problems to do with **model convergence** and **'singular fit'** come into play when the optimiser we are using either can't find a suitable maximum, or gets stuck in a singularity (think of it like a black hole of likelihood, which signifies that there is not enough variation in our data to construct such a complex model).  

```{r}
#| label: fig-maxima
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "49%"
#| fig-cap: "local/global maxima and singularities"
#| fig-align: "center"
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/mle2.png")
```

`r optend()`

# Exercises

## Cross-Sectional: Wellbeing Across Scotland

:::frame
Recall our dataset from last week, in which we used linear regression to determine how outdoor time (hours per week) is associated with wellbeing in different local authority areas (LAAs) of Scotland. We have data from various LAAs, from Glasgow City, to the Highlands.  

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
scotmw <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv")
```
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(gt)
scotmw <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv")
tibble(variable=names(scotmw),
       description=c("Participant ID","Participant Name","Local Authority Area","Self report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors","Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being.

) %>% gt()
```
:::

`r qbegin("1")`
Using `lmer()` from the **lme4** package, fit a model predict `wellbeing` from `outdoor_time`, with by-LAA random intercepts.  
Pass the model to `summary()` to see the output. 
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
#| include: false
scotmw<-read_csv("../../data/LAAwellbeing.csv")
```

```{r}
library(lme4)
ri_model <- lmer(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + (1 | laa), data = scotmw)
summary(ri_model)
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("2")`
Sometimes the easiest way to start understanding your model is to visualise it. 
 
Load the package **broom.mixed**. Along with some handy functions `tidy()` and `glance()` which give us the information we see in `summary()`, there is a handy function called `augment()` which returns us the data in the model plus the fitted values, residuals, hat values, Cook's D etc.. 
```{r}
ri_model <- lmer(wellbeing ~ outdoor_time + (1 | laa), data = scotmw)
library(broom.mixed)
augment(ri_model)
```

Add to the code below to plot the model fitted values, and color them according to LAA. 
(you will need to edit `ri_model` to be whatever name you assigned to your model).

```{r eval=FALSE}
augment(ri_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = outdoor_time, y = ...... 
```

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
augment(ri_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = outdoor_time, y = .fitted, col = laa)) + 
  geom_line()
```
`r solend()`


`r qbegin("3")`
We have just fitted the model:
$$
\begin{align}
& \text{For person } j \text{ in LAA } i \\
& \color{red}{\textrm{Wellbeing}_{ij}}\color{black} = \color{blue}{\beta_{0i} \cdot 1 + \beta_{1} \cdot \textrm{Outdoor Time}_{ij}}\color{black} + \varepsilon_{ij} \\
& \color{blue}{\beta_{0i}}\color{black} = \gamma_{00} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}} \\
\end{align}
$$

For our estimates of $\gamma_{00}$ (the fixed value around which LAA intercepts vary) and $\beta_1$ (the fixed estimate of the relationship between wellbeing and outdoor time), we can use `fixef()`.  
```{r}
fixef(ri_model)
```
Can you add to the plot in the previous question, a thick black line with the intercept and slope given by `fixef()`?  

**Hint:** `geom_abline()`

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

```{r}
augment(ri_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = outdoor_time, y = .fitted, col = laa)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_abline(intercept = fixef(ri_model)[1], slope = fixef(ri_model)[2], lwd = 2)
```
`r solend()`

`r qbegin("4")`
By now, you should have a plot which looks more or less like the left-hand figure below (we have added on the raw data - the points).  
<div style="display:inline-block; width: 55%;vertical-align: top;">
```{r}
#| label: fig-modfit
#| echo: false
#| fig.asp: 1
#| fig-cap: "Model fitted values"
augment(ri_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = outdoor_time, y = .fitted, col = laa)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_abline(intercept = fixef(ri_model)[1], slope = fixef(ri_model)[2], lwd = 2)+
  geom_point(aes(y=wellbeing), alpha=.4)
```
</div>
<div style="display:inline-block; width: 40%;vertical-align: top;">
```{r}
#| label: fig-lmersummap
#| echo: false
#| out.width: "400px"
#| fig-cap: "Summary model output<br>lmer(wellbeing~1 + outdoor_time + (1|laa),<br>data = scotmw)"
knitr::include_graphics("images/intro/summarylmer2.png")
```
</div>
<br>
<br>
We're going to map the parts of the plot in @fig-modfit to the `summary()` output of the model in @fig-lmersummap. Match the coloured sections Red, Orange, Yellow and Blue in @fig-lmersummap to the descriptions below of @fig-modfit A through D. 

A) where the black line cuts the y axis
B) the standard deviation of the distances from all the individual LAA lines to the black lines
C) the slope of the black lines
D) the standard deviation of the distances from all the individual observations to the line for the LAA to which it belongs.

Can you also match those same coloured sections in @fig-lmersummap to the mathematical terms in the model equation:  

$$
\begin{align}
& \text{Level 1:} \\
& \color{red}{Wellbeing_{ij}}\color{black} = \color{blue}{\beta_{0i} \cdot 1 + \beta_{1} \cdot OutdoorTime_{ij}}\color{black} + \varepsilon_{ij} \\
& \text{Level 2:} \\
& \color{blue}{\beta_{0i}}\color{black} = \gamma_{00} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}} \\
\quad \\
& \text{where} \\
& \color{orange}{\zeta_0}\color{black} \sim N(0, \sigma_{\color{orange}{\zeta_{0}}}\color{black})  \text{ independently} \\
& \varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma_{\varepsilon}) \text{ independently} \\
\end{align}
$$

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

+ Yellow = B = $\sigma_{\color{orange}{\zeta_{0}}}$
+ Red = D = $\sigma_{\varepsilon}$    
+ Blue = A = $\gamma_{00}$  
+ Orange = C = $\beta_{1}$     

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("5")`
Fit a model which allows *also* (along with the intercept) the effect of `outdoor_time` to vary by-LAA.   

Then, using `augment()` again, plot the model fitted values. What do you think you will see?  
Does it look like this model better represents the individual LAAs? Take a look at, for instance, Glasgow City.  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
rs_model <- lmer(wellbeing ~ 1 + outdoor_time + (1 + outdoor_time | laa), data = scotmw)

augment(rs_model) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = outdoor_time, y = .fitted, col = laa)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point(aes(y=wellbeing), alpha=.4)
```

## Longitudinal: Wellbeing Over Time

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/WeightMaintain3.rda"))
set.seed(993)
WeightMaintain3 %>% mutate(
  wellbeing = scale(WeightChange)[,1]*4,
  Condition = fct_recode(factor(Condition),
                         "4day_week"="None",
                         "unlimited_leave"="MR",
                         "none"="ED"),
  TimePoint = Assessment+1
) %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% mutate(
    int = rnorm(n(),40,3.5),
    Wellbeing = round(wellbeing + int)
  ) %>% ungroup %>% select(ID, TimePoint, Condition, Wellbeing) -> wellbeingwork3

#save(wellbeingwork3,file="../../data/wellbeingwork3.rda")
```


Another very crucial advantage of these methods is that we can use them to study how people change over time.  

:::frame
__Wellbeing in Work: Longitudinal Data__  

The Wellbeing in Work data (`wellbeingwork3`) contains information on employees who were randomly assigned to one of three employment conditions:

* control: No change to employment. Employees continue at 5 days a week, with standard allocated annual leave quota.    
* unlimited_leave : Employees were given no limit to their annual leave, but were still expected to meet required targets as specified in their job description. 
* fourday_week: Employees worked a 4 day week for no decrease in pay, and were still expected to meet required targets as specified in their job description.

Wellbeing was was assessed at baseline (start of maintenance), 12 months post, 24 months post, and 36 months post.  

The researchers had two main questions: 
- Overall, did the participants' wellbeing stay the same or did it change?
- Did the employment condition groups differ in the how wellbeing changed over the assessment period?   

The data is available, in **.rda** format, at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeingwork3.rda](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeingwork3.rda). You can read it directly into your R environment using: 
```{r}
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/wellbeingwork3.rda"))
```

:::

`r qbegin("6")`  

> Q: Overall, did the participants' wellbeing stay the same or did it change?  


Each of our participants have measurements at 4 assessments. 
We need to think about what this means for the **random effects** that we will include in our model (our **random effect structure**). Would we like our models to accommodate individuals to vary in their overall wellbeing, to vary in how they change in wellbeing over the course of the assessment period, or both?

To investigate whether wellbeing changed over the course of the assessments, or whether it stayed the same, we can fit and compare 2 models:  

1. The "null" or "intercept-only" model. 
2. A model with wellbeing predicted by time point.  

And we can then compare them in terms of model fit. As discussed in the lecture, there are lots of ways to assess inference in multilevel models. 

Our sample size here (180 participants, each with 4 observations) is reasonably large given the relative simplicity of our model. We might consider running a straightforward Likelihood Ratio Test using `anova(restricted_model, full_model)` to compare our two models. 

**Hint: Remember, we shouldn't compare models with different random effect structures.**  

*(For now, don't worry too much about "singular fits". We'll talk more about how we might deal with them next week!)*

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

This is our null model:
```{r}
m.null <- lmer(Wellbeing ~ 1 + (1 | ID), data=wellbeingwork3)
summary(m.null)
```
We can see the `4.82 / (4.82 + 22.48)`, or `r (4.82 / (4.82 + 22.48)) %>% round(.,2)` of the total variance is attributable to participant-level variation. 

Now lets suppose we want to compare this null model with a model with an effect of `TimePoint` (to assess whether there is overall change over time).
Which model should we compare `m.null` to?  
```{r}
#| eval: false
modA <- lmer(Wellbeing ~ 1 + TimePoint + (1 + TimePoint | ID), data=wellbeingwork3)
modB <- lmer(Wellbeing ~ 1 + TimePoint + (1 | ID), data=wellbeingwork3)
```
A comparison between these `m.null` and `modA` will not be assessing the influence of _only_ the fixed effect of TimePoint. 

Remember, we shouldn't compare models with different random effect structures.   

However, `modB` doesn't include our by-participant random effects of timepoint, so comparing this to `m.null` is potentially going to mis-attribute random deviations in participants' change to being an overall effect of timepoint.  

If we want to conduct a model comparison to isolate the effect of overall change over time (a fixed effect of `TimePoint`), we _might_ want to compare these two models:
```{r}
m.base0 <- lmer(Wellbeing ~ 1 + (1 + TimePoint | ID), data=wellbeingwork3)
m.base <- lmer(Wellbeing ~ 1 + TimePoint + (1 + TimePoint | ID), data=wellbeingwork3)
```
The first of these models is a bit weird to think about - how can we have by-participant random deviations of `TimePoint` if we don't have a fixed effect of `TimePoint`? That makes very little sense. What it is actually fitting is a model where there is assumed to be __no overall effect__ of TimePoint. So the fixed effect is 0. 

```{r}
# Straightforward LRT
anova(m.base0, m.base)
```

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("7")`

> Q: Did the employment condition groups differ in the how wellbeing changed over the assessment period?   

*Hint:* It helps to break it down. There are two questions here:  

  1. do groups differ overall?  
  2. do groups differ over time?  

We can begin to see that we're asking two questions about the `Condition` variable here: "is there an effect of Condition?" and "Is there an interaction between TimePoint and Condition?".  

Try fitting two more models which incrementally build these levels of complexity, and compare them (perhaps to one another, perhaps to models from the previous question - think about what each comparison is testing!)  
  
`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
m.int <- lmer(Wellbeing ~ TimePoint + Condition + (TimePoint | ID), 
              data=wellbeingwork3)
m.full <- lmer(Wellbeing ~ TimePoint*Condition + (TimePoint | ID), 
               data=wellbeingwork3)
```

We're going to compare each model to the previous one to examine the improvement in fit due to inclusion of each parameter. 
We could do this quickly with
```{r}
anova(m.base0, m.base, m.int, m.full)
```
:::int 
Conditions differed overall in wellbeing change $\chi^2(2)=11.39, p = .003$  
Conditions differed in change over assessment period $\chi^2(2)=23.71, p < .001$
:::

`r solend()`

`r qbegin("8")`

- Examine the parameter estimates and interpret them (i.e., what does each parameter represent?)
- Make a graph of the model fit *and* the observed data.  

*Hint:* We can get the fixed effects using `fixef(model)`, and we can also use `tidy(model)` from the **broom.mixed** package, and similar to `lm` models in DAPR2, we can pull out the bit of the `summary()` using `summary(model)$coefficients`.  

*Hint:* There are lots of ways you can visualise the model, try a couple: 
  
1. Using the **effects** package, does this help? `as.data.frame(effect("TimePoint:Condition", model))`  
2. Using `fitted(model)`
3. Using `augment()` from the **broom.mixed** package.  
4. **sjPlot**, as we used in DAPR2


`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r}
#| echo: false
round(coef(summary(m.full)), 3)
```

* `(Intercept)` ==> Wellbeing at baseline in 'control' group
* `TimePoint`  ==> Slope of welleing change in 'control' group
* `Conditionunlimited_leave` ==> baseline wellbeing difference from 'unlimited_leave' group relative to 'control' group
* `Conditionfourday_week` ==> baseline wellbeing difference from 'fourday_week' group relative to 'control' group
* `TimePoint:Conditionunlimited_leave`  ==> slope of wellbeing change in 'unlimited_leave' group relative to 'control' group
* `TimePoint:Conditionfourday_week`  ==> slope of wellbeing change in 'fourday_week' group relative to 'control' group

:::int
Compared to the control group, wellbeing increased by 1.35 points/year more for employees with unlimited leave, and by 2.28 points/year for employees on the 4 day week.  
:::

To visualise the model fitted values and observed data, there are various options to choose from. 

1. Using the `effect()` function (and then adding the means and SEs from the original data):  
```{r}
ef <- as.data.frame(effect("TimePoint:Condition", m.full))

ggplot(ef, aes(TimePoint, fit, color=Condition)) + 
  geom_line() +
  stat_summary(data=wellbeingwork3, aes(y=Wellbeing), 
               fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange", size=1) +
  theme_bw()
```

2. Using the `fitted()` function to extract and plot fitted values from the model: 

```{r}
ggplot(wellbeingwork3, aes(TimePoint, Wellbeing, color=Condition)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange", size=1) + 
  stat_summary(aes(y=fitted(m.full)), fun=mean, geom="line") + 
  theme_bw()
```

3. Or using `augment()`:
```{r}
augment(m.full) %>%
ggplot(., aes(TimePoint, Wellbeing, color=Condition)) + 
  stat_summary(fun.data=mean_se, geom="pointrange", size=1) + 
  stat_summary(aes(y=.fitted), fun=mean, geom="line") + 
  theme_bw()
```

4. finally, __sjPlot__ can give us the model fitted values, but it's trickier to add on the observed means. We can add the raw data using `show.data=TRUE`, but that will make it a bit messier

```{r}
library(sjPlot)
plot_model(m.full, type="int")
```

## Repeated Measures: Basketball/HRV

While the wellbeing example considers the groupings or 'clusters' of different LAAs, a more relate-able grouping in psychological research is that of several observations belonging to the same individual. One obvious benefit of this is that we can collect many more observations with fewer participants, and account for the resulting dependency of observations. 

:::frame

Recall the data from the previous week, from an experiment in which heart rate variability (HRV) was measured for amateur basketball players when tasked with scoring a goal with varying levels and type of potential loss/reward. 

The data was split over two files. The code below will read in both datasets and join them for you:

```{r}
bball <- 
  left_join(
    read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/basketballconditions.csv"),
    read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/bballhrv.csv") %>%
      pivot_longer(trial_1:trial_20, names_to = "trial_no", values_to = "hrv")
  ) %>%
  mutate(sub = factor(sub))
```
The resulting dataset has the following variables:  
```{r}
#| echo: false
tibble(variable=names(bball),
       description = c("Size of reward (points to be won/lost on a given trial). Ranges 1 to 20", 
                       "Experimental Condition: Whether the participant was playing for monetary reward ('money') or for a place on the scoreboard ('kudos')",
                       "Participant Identifier","Whether the participant successfully completed the trial","Trial Number (1 to 20)","Average Heart Rate Variability over the 10 seconds prior to throwing")
) %>% gt()
```

Recall that the research question was concerned with how the size and type of potential reward influence stress levels (as measured by heart rate variability):

> How do the size and type of potential reward/loss interact to influence levels of stress? 

Fit a multi-level model to examine the effects of size and type of reward on HRV, and their interaction. 

Remember to think about:  

- what is our outcome variable of interest?
- what are our predictor variables that we are interested in?
    - these should be in the fixed effects part.    
- what is the clustering?
    - this should be the random effects `(1 | cluster)` part
- does size of reward (`stakes`) vary within clusters, or between?
    - if so, we might be able to fit a random slope of `stakes | cluster`. if not, then it doesn't make sense to do so.  
- does type of reward (`condition`) vary within clusters, or between?
      - if so, we might be able to fit a random slope of `condition | cluster`. if not, then it doesn't make sense to do so.

We now have a model, but we don't have any p-values, confidence intervals, or inferential criteria on which to draw conclusions.  

In the longitudinal study of wellbeing over time, we did a series of model comparisons, performing tests of the incremental inclusion of additional parameters. In the Basketball/HRV example we went straight for the full model. This is in part because the two research aims of the longitudinal example can be matched two models (one for the "overall" trajectory, and one looking at differences between groups), whereas the Basketball/HRV research question simply requires the `stakes*condition` interaction.  

There are some options here for you to choose from. 

You can either perform tests against the null that certain parameter estimates are equal to zero, or you can fit a reduced model and conduct model comparisons between that and the full model in order to isolate and test the improvement in the model due to a certain parameter.  

There are different methods of implementing these in R, as detailed in the table below. Standard likelihood ratio tests require models to be fitted with ML, and can be less reliable when samples are small (at any level). Often, approximations of the degrees of freedom are preferable, in part because these allow models to be fitting with REML. The more computationally expensive bootstrapping approach is perhaps the most recommended approach as it can provide more accurate p-values for the likelihood ratio test, as well as confidence intervals for our estimates, but for larger models it can take a lot of time to compute. Additionally, when performing the bootstrap it is important to watch out for issues with convergence in the bootstrap iterations - it may indicate your model needs simplification.  

Method |  Model Comparison |  Parameter Estimation|
|------:|--------:|------------:|
| Likelihood Ratio Test | `anova(model1, model2)` |  |
| Approximations to $ddf$ | Satterthwaite: `SATmodcomp(model2, model1)` from the __pbkrtest__ package.<br>Kenward-Rogers: `KRmodcomp(model2, model1)` from the __pbkrtest__ package  | Satterthwaite: load the __lmerTest__ package and re-fit your model (the summary output will then have p-values)  |
| Parametric Bootstrap | `PBmodcomp(model2, model1)` from the __pbkrtest__ package | `confint(model, method="boot")`|
