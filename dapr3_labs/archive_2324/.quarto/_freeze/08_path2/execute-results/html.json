For instance, what if we believe that participants' religiosity has an effect on their Health Locus of Control score, __*which in turn*__ affects the intention to vaccinate (see @fig-medpath1)?   \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Mediation as a path model (If you're interested, you can find the inspiration for this example data from the paper [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7596314/). I haven't properly read it though!)](images/path/path2.png){#fig-medpath1 fig-align='center' width=80% height=300px}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this case, the HLC variable is thought of as a **mediator**, because it mediates the effect of religiosity on intention to vaccinate. In this theoretical model, we distinguishing between two possible types of effect: **direct** and **indirect**. \n\n:::statbox\n**Direct vs Indirect**  \n\nIn path diagrams:\n\n- Direct effect = one single-headed arrow between the two variables concerned  \n- Indirect effect = An effect transmitted via some other variables   \n\n:::\n\n:::\n\nWe've seen how path analysis works in last week's lab, and we can use that same logic to investigate models which have quite different structures such as those including mediating variables. \n\nBecause we have multiple **endogenous** variables here, then we're immediately drawn to path analysis, because we're in essence thinking of conducting several regression models. As we can't fit our theoretical model into a nice straightforward regression model (we would need several), then we can use path analysis instead, and just smush lots of regressions together, allowing us to estimate things all at once.  \n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Doing Path Mediation 1: Data\n\nWe'll continue with the example in @fig-medpath1, for which we have simulated some data.  \n\n:::frame\n__Data: VaxDat.csv__\n\n100 parents were recruited and completed a survey that included measures of Health Locus of Control, Religiosity, and a sliding scale of 0 to 100 on how definite they were that their child would receive the vaccination for measles, mumps & rubella.  \n\n- Intention to vaccinate (scored on a range of 0-100)  \n- Health Locus of Control (HLC) score (average on a set of 5 items - each scoring 0 to 6 - relating to perceived control over ones own health)  \n- Religiosity of upbringing (average score on a set of items relating to the religiosity of an individual's childhood). \n\nThe data is available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/vaxdat.csv  \n\n:::\n\nFirst we read in our data:  \n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nvax <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/vaxdat.csv\")\nsummary(vax)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  religiosity        hlc         intention   \n Min.   :-1.0   Min.   :0.40   Min.   :39.0  \n 1st Qu.: 1.8   1st Qu.:2.00   1st Qu.:59.0  \n Median : 2.4   Median :3.00   Median :64.0  \n Mean   : 2.4   Mean   :2.99   Mean   :65.1  \n 3rd Qu.: 3.0   3rd Qu.:3.60   3rd Qu.:74.0  \n Max.   : 4.6   Max.   :5.80   Max.   :88.0  \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks like we have a value we shouldn't have there.

[Click here for a lovely explanation from Aja Murray](https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/indirect_effects.pdf)).  \n  \nTo do this, we use a new operator, `:=`. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmed_model <- \" \n    intention ~ religiosity\n    intention ~ a*hlc\n    hlc ~ b*religiosity\n    \n    indirect:=a*b\n\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n:::rtip\n**:=** \n\n_This operator 'defines' new parameters which take on values that are an arbitrary function of the original model parameters. The function, however, must be specified in terms of the parameter labels that are explicitly mentioned in the model syntax._\n  \n([the lavaan project](https://lavaan.ugent.be/))\n\nNote. The labels we use are completely up to us. This would be equivalent:\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmed_model <- \" \n    intention ~ religiosity\n    intention ~ peppapig * hlc\n    hlc ~ kermit * religiosity\n    \n    indirect:= kermit * peppapig\n\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Doing Path Mediation 1: Model Estimation\n\nIt is common to estimate the indirect effect using a bootstrapping approach (remember, bootstrapping involves resampling the data with replacement, thousands of times, in order to empirically generate a sampling distribution).  \n\n:::statbox\n__Why do we bootstrap mediation analysis?__\n\nWe compute our indirect effect as the _product_ of the sub-component paths. However, this results in the estimated indirect effect rarely following a normal distribution, and makes our usual analytically derived standard errors & p-values inappropriate.   \nInstead, bootstrapping has become the norm for assessing sampling distributions of indirect effects in mediation models. \n\n::: \n\nWe can do this easily in lavaan:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmm1.est <- sem(med_model, data=vax, se = \"bootstrap\") \nsummary(mm1.est, ci = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nlavaan 0.6.16 ended normally after 1 iteration\n\n  Estimator                                         ML\n  Optimization method                           NLMINB\n  Number of model parameters                         5\n\n                                                  Used       Total\n  Number of observations                            99         100\n\nModel Test User Model:\n                                                      \n  Test statistic                                 0.000\n  Degrees of freedom                                 0\n\nParameter Estimates:\n\n  Standard errors                            Bootstrap\n  Number of requested bootstrap draws             1000\n  Number of successful bootstrap draws             996\n\nRegressions:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(>|z|) ci.lower ci.upper\n  intention ~                                                           \n    religiosty        0.616    1.141    0.540    0.589   -1.650    2.750\n    hlc        (a)    5.823    0.963    6.047    0.000    3.972    7.685\n  hlc ~                                                                 \n    religiosty (b)    0.557    0.084    6.611    0.000    0.383    0.724\n\nVariances:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(>|z|) ci.lower ci.upper\n   .intention        62.112    8.090    7.677    0.000   44.865   76.586\n   .hlc               0.741    0.102    7.230    0.000    0.553    0.959\n\nDefined Parameters:\n                   Estimate  Std.Err  z-value  P(>|z|) ci.lower ci.upper\n    indirect          3.243    0.715    4.532    0.000    2.009    4.752\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::int\nWe can see that the 95% bootstrapped confidence interval for the indirect effect of religiosity on intention to vaccinate does not include zero.

Having more aggressive or non-aggressive conduct problems is associated with poorer academic performance.   \n\nWe can also see that we get the same results when we use the `sem()` function as we do when we use the `lm()` function. Lavaan will give essentially the same results as `lm()` for simple  and multiple regression problems. However, if we have multiple outcome variables in our model it is advantageous to do this using path mediation model with lavaan.

In the model, academic performance was regressed on teacher relationship quality, non-aggressive conduct problems and aggressive conduct problems while teacher relationship quality (the mediator) was regressed on aggressive and non-aggressive conduct problems. The indirect effects were tested using the product of the coefficient for the regression of outcome on mediator and the coefficient for the regression of mediator on predictor. The statistical significance of the indirect effects were evaluated using boostrapped 95% confidence intervals with 1000 draws.\n\nUnstandardised parameter estimates are provided in @fig-pathcp. Solid lines indicate that a parameter is significant at $p <. 05$, while dashed lines represent non-significant paths.The indirect effects of both non-aggressive  ($b = -0.09$, 95% CI=[-0.14, -0.05]) and aggressive ($b = -0.15$, 95% CI=[-0.21, -.08]) conduct problems on academic performance were statistically significant. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Effect of conduct problems on academic performance mediated by quality of teacher relationship.](images/path/pathanaly1.png){#fig-pathcp fig-align='center' width=1200px}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n\n\n</div><p class=\"solution-end\"></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"divider div-transparent div-dot\"></div>\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n## Mediation using separate models\n\nFollowing [Baron & Kenny 1986](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.917.2326&rep=rep1&type=pdf), we can conduct mediation analysis by using three separate regression models.  \n\n1. $y \\sim x$\n2. $m \\sim x$\n3. $y \\sim x + m$\n\nStep 1.

If Steps 1-3 all show effects of `y~x`, `m~x` and `y~m|x`^[read `y~m|x` as `y~m` controlling for `x`] respectively, then we can assess mediation. We need to look at the effect of the predictor on the outcome after controlling for the mediator. This is from the same third model above. If the effect of the predictor is now zero, then we have complete mediation. If it is non-zero, then we have _partial_ mediation. \n\n::: {.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Optional - packages for estimating mediation effects\n\nThe __mediation__ package is a very nice approach that allows us to conduct mediation this way, and it also extends to allow us to have categorical variables (we can use a logistic regression as one of our models), or to have multilevel data (our models can be fitted using __lme4__).  \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(mediation)\nmymediation <- mediate(model.m = mod2, \n                       model.y = mod3, \n                       treat='religiosity', \n                       mediator='hlc',\n                       boot=TRUE, sims=500)\n\nsummary(mymediation)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCausal Mediation Analysis \n\nNonparametric Bootstrap Confidence Intervals with the Percentile Method\n\n               Estimate 95% CI Lower 95% CI Upper p-value    \nACME              3.243        2.060         4.58  <2e-16 ***\nADE               0.616       -1.474         2.92    0.57    \nTotal Effect      3.858        1.700         5.74  <2e-16 ***\nProp.
