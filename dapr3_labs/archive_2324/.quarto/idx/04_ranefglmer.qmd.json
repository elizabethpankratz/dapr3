However, this week we're going to look at how to deal with this issue.\n\n<p style=\"color:red\">boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular</p>\n\nThe warning is telling us that our model has resulted in a 'singular fit'. Singular fits often indicate that the model is 'overfitted' - that is, the random effects structure which we have specified is too complex to be supported by the data.  \n\nPerhaps the most intuitive advice would be remove the most complex part of the random effects structure (i.e. random slopes). This leads to a simpler model that is not over-fitted. In other words, start simplifying from the top (where the most complexity is) to the bottom (where the lowest complexity is).\nAdditionally, when variance estimates are very low for a specific random effect term, this indicates that the model is not estimating this parameter to differ much between the levels of your grouping variable. It might, in some experimental designs, be perfectly acceptable to remove this or simply include it as a fixed effect.\n\nA key point here is that when fitting a mixed model, we should think about how the data are generated. Asking yourself questions such as \"do we have good reason to assume subjects might vary over time, or to assume that they will have different starting points (i.e., different intercepts)?\" can help you in specifying your random effect structure\n\nYou can read in depth about what this means by reading the help documentation for `?isSingular`. For our purposes, a relevant section is copied below:  \n\n*... intercept-only models, or 2-dimensional random effects such as intercept + slope models, singularity is relatively easy to detect because it leads to random-effect variance estimates of (nearly) zero, or estimates of correlations that are (almost) exactly -1 or 1.*\n\n:::\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Convergence warnings  \n\nIssues of non-convergence can be caused by many things. If you're model doesn't converge, it does *not necessarily* mean the fit is incorrect, however it is **is cause for concern**, and should be addressed, else you may end up reporting inferences which do not hold.\n\nThere are lots of different things which you could do which *might* help your model to converge. A select few are detailed below:  \n\n- double-check the model specification and the data  \n\n- adjust stopping (convergence) tolerances for the nonlinear optimizer, using the optCtrl argument to [g]lmerControl. (see `?convergence` for convergence controls). \n    - What is \"tolerance\"? Remember that our optimizer is the the method by which the computer finds the best fitting model, by iteratively assessing and trying to maximise the likelihood (or minimise the loss). \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-tolerance \n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: \"An optimizer will stop after a certain number of iterations, or when it meets a tolerance threshold\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/tolerance.png\")\n```\n\n- center and scale continuous predictor variables (e.g. with `scale`)  \n\n- Change the optimization method (for example, here we change it to `bobyqa`):\n    `lmer(..., control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))`  \n    `glmer(..., control = glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))`  \n\n- Increase the number of optimization steps:\n    `lmer(..., control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\", optCtrl=list(maxfun=50000))`  \n    `glmer(..., control = glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\", optCtrl=list(maxfun=50000))`  \n\n- Use `allFit()` to try the fit with all available optimizers. This will of course be slow, but is considered 'the gold standard'; *\"if all optimizers converge to values that are practically equivalent, then we would consider the convergence warnings to be false positives.\"*  \n\n- Consider simplifying your model, for example by removing random effects with the smallest variance (but be careful to not simplify more than necessary, and ensure that your write up details these changes)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Model Building\n\nRandom effect structures can get pretty complicated quite quickly. Very often it is not the random effects part that is of specific interest to us, but we wish to estimate random effects in order to more accurately partition up the variance in our outcome variable and provide better estimates of fixed effects.  \n\nIt is a fine balance between fitting the most sophisticated model structure that we possibly can, and fitting a model that converges without too much simplification. Typically for many research designs, the following steps will keep you mostly on track to finding the maximal model:  \n\n`lmer(outcome ~ fixed effects + (random effects | grouping structure))`  \n\n1. Specify the `outcome ~ fixed effects` bit first. \n    - The outcome variable should be clear: it is the variable we are wishing to explain/predict. \n    - The fixed effects are the things we want to use to explain/predict variation in the outcome variable. These will often be the things that are of specific inferential interest, and other covariates. Just like the simple linear model.  \n    \n2. If there is a grouping structure to your data, and those groups (preferably n>7 or 8) are perceived as a random sample of a wider population (the specific groups aren't interesting to you), then consider including random intercepts (and possibly random slopes of predictors) for those groups `(1 | grouping)`.  \n\n3. If there are multiple different grouping structures, is one nested within another? (If so, we can specify this as `(1 | high_level_grouping / low_level_grouping)`.  If the grouping structures are not nested, we specify them as crossed: `(1 | grouping1) + (1 | grouping2)`.  \n\n\n4. If any of the things in the fixed effects vary within the groups, it might be possible to also include them as random effects.  \n    - as a general rule, don't specify random effects that are not also specified as fixed effects (an exception could be specifically for model comparison, to isolate the contribution of the fixed effect).  \n    - For things that do not vary within the groups, it rarely makes sense to include them as random effects. For instance if we had a model with `lmer(score ~ genetic_status + (1 + genetic_status | patient))` then we would be trying to model a process where \"the effect of genetic_status on scores is different for each patient\". But if you consider an individual patient, their genetic status never changes. For patient $i$, what is \"the effect of genetic status on score\"? It's undefined. This is because genetic status only varies _between_ patients.\n    - Sometimes, things will vary within one grouping, but not within another. E.g. with patients nested within hospitals `(1 | hospital/patient)`, genetic_status varies _between_ patients, but _within_ hospitals. Therefore we could theoretically fit a random effect of `genetic_status | hospital`, but __not__ one for `genetic_status | patient`.  \n    We can include these while preserving the nested structure of the data by separating out the groupings: `(1 + genetic_status | hospital) + (1 | patient:hospital)`.  \n\n5. A common approach to fitting multilevel models is to fit the most complex model _that the study design allows_. This means including random effects for everything that makes _theoretical_ sense to be included. Because this \"maximal model\" will often not converge, we then simplify our random effect structure to obtain a convergent model.  \nCandidate random effect terms for removal are:\n  - overly complex terms (e.g. `(1 + x1 * x2 | group)` could be simplified to `(1 + x1 + x2 | group)`).  \n  - those with little variance\n  - those with near perfect correlation (we can alternatively remove just the correlation)\n\n6. Obtain final model, and proceed to checking assumptions, checking influence, plotting, and eventually writing up.  \n\n<!-- `r optbegin(\"An example\", olabel=F)` -->\n<!-- Suppose we were also interested in the association between population density and wellbeing.

One group studied the material twice (`StudyStudy`), the other group studied the material once then did a test (`StudyTest`). Recall was tested immediately (one minute) after the learning session and one week later. The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (`Test_word`). \n\nThe researchers are interested in how test-enhanced learning influences time-to-recall. The critical (replication) prediction is that the `StudyTest` group will retain the material better (lower reaction times) on the 1-week follow-up test compared to the `StudyStudy` group.  \n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/RTtestlearning.RData\"))\ntibble(\n  variable=names(telrt),\n  description=c(\"Unique Participant Identifier\", \"Group denoting whether the participant studied the material twice (StudyStudy), or studied it once then did a test (StudyTest)\",\"Time of recall test ('min' = Immediate, 'week' = One week later)\",\"Word being recalled (175 different test words)\",\"Time to respond (milliseconds)\")\n) %>% knitr::kable()\n```\n\nThe following code loads the data into your R environment by creating a variable called `tel`:\n```{}\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/RTtestlearning.RData\"))\n```\n\n:::\n\n\n`r qbegin(\"1\")`\nLoad and plot the data.  \n\nFor this week, we'll use Reaction Time as our proxy for the test performance, so you'll probably want that variable on the y-axis.  \n\nDoes it look like the effect was replicated?\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hints\n\nOur outcome variable is reaction time, so we'll want to plot that on the y axis.  \n\nAs described in the data summary, this is a replication, and the prediction is that the `StudyTest` group will retain the material better (have lower reaction times) on the 1-week follow-up test compared to the `StudyStudy` group.  \n\nSo we want to show the reaction times for each group, at each test (`min` or `week` delay).

Thinking about the study, if we are going to remove __one__ of the by-testword random effects (`Delay` or `Group`), which one do we consider to be more theoretically justified? Is the effect of Delay likely to vary by test-words? More so than the effect of group is likely to vary by test-words? Quite possibly - there's no obvious reason for _certain_ words to be more memorable for people in one group vs another. But there is reason for words to vary in the effect that delay of one week has - how familiar a word is will likely influence the amount to which a week's delay has on recall.   \n\nLet's remove the by-testword random effect of group. \n```{r}\nm2 <- lmer(Rtime ~ Delay*Group +\n             (1 + Delay | Subject_ID) +\n             (1 + Delay | Test_word),\n           data=telrt, control=lmerControl(optimizer = \"bobyqa\"))\nisSingular(m2)\nVarCorr(m2)\n```\nHooray, the model converged! \n```{r}\nsummary(m2)\n```\n\nLet's quickly visualise the interaction.

However, this week we're going to look at how to deal with this issue.\n\n<p style=\"color:red\">boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular</p>\n\nThe warning is telling us that our model has resulted in a 'singular fit'. Singular fits often indicate that the model is 'overfitted' - that is, the random effects structure which we have specified is too complex to be supported by the data.  \n\nPerhaps the most intuitive advice would be remove the most complex part of the random effects structure (i.e. random slopes). This leads to a simpler model that is not over-fitted. In other words, start simplifying from the top (where the most complexity is) to the bottom (where the lowest complexity is).\nAdditionally, when variance estimates are very low for a specific random effect term, this indicates that the model is not estimating this parameter to differ much between the levels of your grouping variable. It might, in some experimental designs, be perfectly acceptable to remove this or simply include it as a fixed effect.\n\nA key point here is that when fitting a mixed model, we should think about how the data are generated. Asking yourself questions such as \"do we have good reason to assume subjects might vary over time, or to assume that they will have different starting points (i.e., different intercepts)?\" can help you in specifying your random effect structure\n\nYou can read in depth about what this means by reading the help documentation for `?isSingular`. For our purposes, a relevant section is copied below:  \n\n*... intercept-only models, or 2-dimensional random effects such as intercept + slope models, singularity is relatively easy to detect because it leads to random-effect variance estimates of (nearly) zero, or estimates of correlations that are (almost) exactly -1 or 1.*\n\n:::\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Convergence warnings  \n\nIssues of non-convergence can be caused by many things. If you're model doesn't converge, it does *not necessarily* mean the fit is incorrect, however it is **is cause for concern**, and should be addressed, else you may end up reporting inferences which do not hold.\n\nThere are lots of different things which you could do which *might* help your model to converge. A select few are detailed below:  \n\n- double-check the model specification and the data  \n\n- adjust stopping (convergence) tolerances for the nonlinear optimizer, using the optCtrl argument to [g]lmerControl. (see `?convergence` for convergence controls). \n    - What is \"tolerance\"? Remember that our optimizer is the the method by which the computer finds the best fitting model, by iteratively assessing and trying to maximise the likelihood (or minimise the loss). \n\n```{r}\n#| label: fig-tolerance \n#| echo: false\n#| fig-cap: \"An optimizer will stop after a certain number of iterations, or when it meets a tolerance threshold\"\nknitr::include_graphics(\"images/tolerance.png\")\n```\n\n- center and scale continuous predictor variables (e.g. with `scale`)  \n\n- Change the optimization method (for example, here we change it to `bobyqa`):\n    `lmer(..., control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))`  \n    `glmer(..., control = glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))`  \n\n- Increase the number of optimization steps:\n    `lmer(..., control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\", optCtrl=list(maxfun=50000))`  \n    `glmer(..., control = glmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\", optCtrl=list(maxfun=50000))`  \n\n- Use `allFit()` to try the fit with all available optimizers. This will of course be slow, but is considered 'the gold standard'; *\"if all optimizers converge to values that are practically equivalent, then we would consider the convergence warnings to be false positives.\"*  \n\n- Consider simplifying your model, for example by removing random effects with the smallest variance (but be careful to not simplify more than necessary, and ensure that your write up details these changes)\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n### Model Building\n\nRandom effect structures can get pretty complicated quite quickly. Very often it is not the random effects part that is of specific interest to us, but we wish to estimate random effects in order to more accurately partition up the variance in our outcome variable and provide better estimates of fixed effects.  \n\nIt is a fine balance between fitting the most sophisticated model structure that we possibly can, and fitting a model that converges without too much simplification. Typically for many research designs, the following steps will keep you mostly on track to finding the maximal model:  \n\n`lmer(outcome ~ fixed effects + (random effects | grouping structure))`  \n\n1. Specify the `outcome ~ fixed effects` bit first. \n    - The outcome variable should be clear: it is the variable we are wishing to explain/predict. \n    - The fixed effects are the things we want to use to explain/predict variation in the outcome variable. These will often be the things that are of specific inferential interest, and other covariates. Just like the simple linear model.  \n    \n2. If there is a grouping structure to your data, and those groups (preferably n>7 or 8) are perceived as a random sample of a wider population (the specific groups aren't interesting to you), then consider including random intercepts (and possibly random slopes of predictors) for those groups `(1 | grouping)`.  \n\n3. If there are multiple different grouping structures, is one nested within another? (If so, we can specify this as `(1 | high_level_grouping / low_level_grouping)`.  If the grouping structures are not nested, we specify them as crossed: `(1 | grouping1) + (1 | grouping2)`.  \n\n\n4. If any of the things in the fixed effects vary within the groups, it might be possible to also include them as random effects.  \n    - as a general rule, don't specify random effects that are not also specified as fixed effects (an exception could be specifically for model comparison, to isolate the contribution of the fixed effect).  \n    - For things that do not vary within the groups, it rarely makes sense to include them as random effects. For instance if we had a model with `lmer(score ~ genetic_status + (1 + genetic_status | patient))` then we would be trying to model a process where \"the effect of genetic_status on scores is different for each patient\". But if you consider an individual patient, their genetic status never changes. For patient $i$, what is \"the effect of genetic status on score\"? It's undefined. This is because genetic status only varies _between_ patients.\n    - Sometimes, things will vary within one grouping, but not within another. E.g. with patients nested within hospitals `(1 | hospital/patient)`, genetic_status varies _between_ patients, but _within_ hospitals. Therefore we could theoretically fit a random effect of `genetic_status | hospital`, but __not__ one for `genetic_status | patient`.  \n    We can include these while preserving the nested structure of the data by separating out the groupings: `(1 + genetic_status | hospital) + (1 | patient:hospital)`.  \n\n5. A common approach to fitting multilevel models is to fit the most complex model _that the study design allows_. This means including random effects for everything that makes _theoretical_ sense to be included. Because this \"maximal model\" will often not converge, we then simplify our random effect structure to obtain a convergent model.  \nCandidate random effect terms for removal are:\n  - overly complex terms (e.g. `(1 + x1 * x2 | group)` could be simplified to `(1 + x1 + x2 | group)`).  \n  - those with little variance\n  - those with near perfect correlation (we can alternatively remove just the correlation)\n\n6. Obtain final model, and proceed to checking assumptions, checking influence, plotting, and eventually writing up.  \n\n<!-- `r optbegin(\"An example\", olabel=F)` -->\n<!-- Suppose we were also interested in the association between population density and wellbeing.

One group studied the material twice (`StudyStudy`), the other group studied the material once then did a test (`StudyTest`). Recall was tested immediately (one minute) after the learning session and one week later. The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (`Test_word`). \n\nThe researchers are interested in how test-enhanced learning influences time-to-recall.

The model was fitting with maximum likelihood estimation using the default optimiser from the **lme4** package (Bates et al., 2015).  \n95% Confidence for fixed effect estimates were constructed by case-based bootstrapping with 2000 bootstraps in which children, (but neither observations within children nor the schools within which children were nested) were resampled. \nResults indicated that children's scores on the BNT60 increased over the 5 years in which they were studied, with children from bilingual schools increasing in scores by `r res[2,2]` ([`r paste(unlist(res[2,3:4]),collapse=\" -- \")`]) every school year. There was a significant interaction between mono/bilingual schools and changes over the school year, with children from monolingual schools increasing `r res[4,2]` ([`r paste(unlist(res[4,3:4]),collapse=\" -- \")`]) less than those from bilingual schools for every additional year of school.
