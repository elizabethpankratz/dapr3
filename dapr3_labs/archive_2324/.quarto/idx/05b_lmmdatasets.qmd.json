Every year, the parents were asked to fill out an informant-based version of the Aggressive Behaviour Scale (ABS), measuring verbal and physical abuse, socially inappropriate behavior, and resisting care.

Alongside this, parents from a cohort of students entering 10 further high schools in the state were recruited to also complete the same informant-based ABS, but were not offered the PMT group sessions.  \nThe commissioner has two main questions: **Does the presentation of aggressive behaviours increase as children enter the secondary school system?

Once a week for 5 consecutive weeks, participants were asked to complete two questionnaires, one assessing their level of hunger, and one assessing their level of irritability. The time and day at which participants were assessed was at a randomly chosen hour between 7am and 7pm each week. 46 of the participants were following a five-two diet (five days of normal eating, 2 days of fasting), and the remaining 35 were following no specific diet.  \n\n**DATASET:** [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/hangry.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/hangry.csv)  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nhangry<-read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/hangry.csv\") %>% mutate(fivetwo=factor(fivetwo))\ntibble(\n    variable = names(hangry),\n    description = c(\"Score on irritability questionnaire (0:100)\",\n                    \"Score on hunger questionnaire (0:100)\",\n                    \"Participant Identifier\",\n                    \"Whether the participant follows the five-two diet\")\n) %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Test-enhanced learning  \n\nAn experiment was run to conceptually replicate \"test-enhanced learning\" (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006): two groups of 25 participants were presented with material to learn. One group studied the material twice (`StudyStudy`), the other group studied the material once then did a test (`StudyTest`). Recall was tested immediately (one minute) after the learning session and one week later. The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (`Test_word`). \n\nThe researchers are interested in how test-enhanced learning influences time-to-recall. The critical (replication) prediction is that the `StudyTest` group will retain the material better (lower reaction times) on the 1-week follow-up test compared to the `StudyStudy` group.  \n\n**DATASET:** [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/RTtestlearning.RData](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/RTtestlearning.RData)\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nload(url(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/RTtestlearning.RData\"))\ntibble(\n  variable=names(telrt),\n  description=c(\"Unique Participant Identifier\", \"Group denoting whether the participant studied the material twice (StudyStudy), or studied it once then did a test (StudyTest)\",\"Time of recall test ('min' = Immediate, 'week' = One week later)\",\"Word being recalled (175 different test words)\",\"Time to respond (milliseconds)\")\n) %>% gt::gt()\n```\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Mono/bilingual differences in vocabulary development\n\n74 children from 10 schools were administered the full Boston Naming Test (BNT-60) on a yearly basis for 5 years to examine development of word retrieval.

Every year, the parents were asked to fill out an informant-based version of the Aggressive Behaviour Scale (ABS), measuring verbal and physical abuse, socially inappropriate behavior, and resisting care. Where possible, the same parents were followed up throughout the child's progression through high school. Alongside this, parents from a cohort of students entering 10 further high schools in the state were recruited to also complete the same informant-based ABS, but were not offered the PMT group sessions.  \nThe commissioner has two main questions: **Does the presentation of aggressive behaviours increase as children enter the secondary school system? If so, is there any evidence for the effectiveness of Parent Management Training (PMT) group sessions in curbing the rise of aggressive behaviors during a child's transition into the secondary school system?**  \n\n**DATASET:** [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/abs_intervention.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/abs_intervention.csv) \n\n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\nd3 <- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/abs_intervention.csv\")\ntibble(variable=names(d3),\n       description = c(\n         \"School Name\",\n         \"Participant Identifier\",\n         \"Age (years)\",\n         \"Whether or not parents attended Parent Management Training (PMT) group sessions (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\",\n         \"Aggressive Behaviours Scale.

Each participant completed the route 3 times (i.e. \"repeated measures\"), but each time they were listening to different audio (either speech, classical music or rap music). Their average speed across the route was recorded. \nThis is a fairly simple design, that we might use to ask **\"how is the type of audio being listened to associated with driving speeds?\"** \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drivingmusicwithin.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drivingmusicwithin.csv).  \n\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\ntibble(\n  variable = names(read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drivingmusicwithin.csv\")),\n  description = c(\"Participant Identifier\",\"Avg Speed Driven on Route (mph)\",\"Music listened to while driving (classical music / rap music / spoken word)\")\n) |> gt::gt()\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Practice 2: CBT and Stress\n\nThese data are simulated to represent data from 50 participants, each measured at 3 different time-points (pre, during, and post) on a measure of stress.

Fluency of the statements was counterbalanced such that 15 participants heard statements 1 to 10 as fluent and 11 to 20 as disfluent, and the remaining 15 participants heard statements 1 to 10 as disfluent, and 11 to 20 as fluent. The order of the statements presented to each participant was random.

The study team are interested in **whether different cognitive domains have different trajectories as people age**. Do all cognitive domains decline at the same rate? Do some decline more steeply, and some less? The literature suggests that scores on cognitive ability are predicted by educational attainment, so they would like to control for this.  \n\nEach of the 17 research centers recruited a minimum of 14 participants (Median = 21, Range 14-29) at age 45, and recorded their level of education (in years). Participants were then tested on 5 cognitive domains: processing speed, spatial visualisation, memory, reasoning, and vocabulary. Participants were contacted for follow-up on a further 9 occasions (resulting in 10 datapoints for each participant), and at every follow-up they were tested on the same 5 cognitive domains. Follow-ups were on average 3 years apart (Mean = 3, SD = 0.8). \n\nThe data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cogdecline.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cogdecline.csv). \n\n```{r
