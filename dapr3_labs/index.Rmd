Welcome to the Data Analysis for Psychology in R 3 (DAPR3) lab workbook. Using the menu above, you can find lab materials for each week. These include sets of exercises along with walkthrough readings in which we introduce some of the more important R code. It is strongly recommended that students have taken Data Analysis for Psychology in R 1 and 2  (DAPR1 & DAPR2).   
   
#### Solutions   
Solutions will be made available immediately below each exercise, in the week *after* they are set, so make sure to re-visit the labs to check your answers.
