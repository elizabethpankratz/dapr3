We are now assuming $\color{orange}{\zeta_0}$, $\color{orange}{\zeta_1}$, and $\varepsilon$ to be normally distributed with a mean of 0, and we denote their variances as $\sigma_{\color{orange}{\zeta_0}}^2$, $\sigma_{\color{orange}{\zeta_1}}^2$, $\sigma_\varepsilon^2$ respectively.   

The $\color{orange}{\zeta}$ components also get termed the "random effects" part of the model, Hence names like "random effects model", etc.

???
- clever MLM = model group deviations as a distribution
- NOTE: a bit like the errors epsilon are deviations around a line, zetas are random deviations around some estimate
- what model is actually _estimating_ is __not__ the zetas, but _variances_ (sd) of the zetas

- hence "random effects" - we are supposing the school differences are because we have randomly sampled a set of schools
- different schools = different set of deviations
- randomly drawn from a population of schools

- NOTE we can choose what to be random effect
  - e.g. random intercept

# Notation 

**Mixed-effects == Multi Level**

Sometimes, you will see the levels collapsed into one equation, as it might make for more intuitive reading:

$\color{red}{y_{ij}} = \underbrace{(\gamma_{00} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}})}_{\color{blue}{\beta_{0i}}} \cdot 1 + \underbrace{(\gamma_{10} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{1i}})}_{\color{blue}{\beta_{1i}}} \cdot x_{ij}  +  \varepsilon_{ij} \\$

.footnote[
**other notation to be aware of**  

- Many people use the symbol $u$ in place of $\zeta$  

- Sometimes people use $\beta_{00}$ instead of $\gamma_{00}$  

- In various resources, you are likely to see $\alpha$ used to denote the intercept instead of $\beta_0$  

]

???
- MLM collapses into one line
- sub in level 2 eqs into level 1
- termed "Mixed Effects" because effects = a mix of fixed values and random deviations around them.

$\color{orange}{\zeta_i}$ is "random" because considered a random sample from larger population such that $\color{orange}{\zeta_i} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\color{orange}{\zeta_i}})$. 

???
- both MLM or "mixed effects", we model our "effects" (i.e., the estimated influence that variables exert over our outcome) as randomly varying across our observed groups. 
- our effects can either be:
  - a fixed constant for all our groups
  - a fixed estimate around which our groups randomly vary.   

- [EQUATION] effect of beta2 is just a single constant
- effect of beta0 and beta1 are fixed values around which we have groups deviating

---
# Grouping = Fixed or Random?

I have groups, should I:  

a. include group as a predictor $\color{blue}{\beta \cdot Group}$  
b. consider the grouping to be 'clusters' and include group-level random effects $\color{orange}{\zeta_{i}}$

| Criterion: | Repetition: <br> _If the experiment were repeated:_ | Desired inference: <br> _The conclusions refer to:_ |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed effects  | <center>Same levels would be used</center>     |    <center>The levels used </center>                                   |
| Random effects | <center>Different levels would be used</center>   | <center>A population from which the levels used<br> are just a (random) sample</center> |

Practical points:  
- Sometimes there isn't enough variability between groups to model random effects. 
  - $\sigma^2_{\color{orange}{\zeta}}$ gets estimated as (too close to) zero.
- Sometimes you might not have sufficient data (e.g. only have 6 'clusters'). 
  - estimate of $\sigma^2_{\color{orange}{\zeta}}$ needs sufficient $n$  

???
- random parts = those we consider to be random sample from larger population
- school/child example - schools themselves are a sample of schools
- instead of schools, we had whether the child was public vs private school
  - only 2 groups, and chance is that these are of specific inferential interest
- you can think of it as "if someone were to replicate this experiment, would they use the same levels of this variable?". 


- important: not everything that can be modelled as a random effect SHOULD be modelled as such.  
- for example, recall these models estimate the variance in group deviations around fixed estimates. 
  - with 3 groups, we have 3 deviations. but that's only 3 datapoints to base an estimate of variance on

# Advantages of MLM

Multi-level models can be used to answer multi-level questions!  
<br><br>
Do phenomena at Level X predict __outcomes__ at Level Y?  

__example:__  
Does number of siblings predict variation in scores in childrens' first year of school?  

$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{score}_{ij} &= \beta_{0i} + \beta_1\textrm{year}_j + \varepsilon_{ij} \\
\beta_{0i} &= \gamma_{00} + \zeta_{0i} + \gamma_{01}\textrm{nr siblings}_i
\end{align}
$$
<br>
Single equation:  
$$
\begin{equation}
\textrm{score}_{ij} = (\gamma_{00} + \zeta_{0i}) + \gamma_{01}\textrm{nr siblings}_i + \beta_1\textrm{year}_j + \varepsilon_{ij}
\end{equation}
$$

???
- other than being one method of accounting for clustering in data, why fit MLM?
- MLM allows us to ask some interesting multilevel questions
- e.g. does some predictor at one level influences outcomes at another level.
- [EXAMPLE] we have measured childrens' performance on a test over time, so multiple observations per child. we fit a model where children's intercept varies, and we ask whether this is predicted by their nr of siblings 
- note that really this is identical to a beta. it's a fixed constant, it just applies to something measured at level 2

# Advantages of MLM

Multi-level models can be used to answer multi-level questions!  
<br><br>
Do phenomena at Level X influence __effects__ at Level Y?  

__example:__  
Does being mono/bi-lingual influence childrens' improvement in scores over time?  

$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{score}_{ij} &= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1i}\textrm{year}_j + \varepsilon_{ij} \\  
\beta_{1i} &= \gamma_{10} + \zeta_{1i} + \gamma_{11}\textrm{bilingual}_i
\end{align}
$$

<br>
Single equation:   
$$
\begin{equation}
\textrm{score}_{ij} = \beta_{0} + (\gamma_{10} + \zeta_{1i})\cdot\textrm{year}_j + \gamma_{11}\textrm{bilingual}_i\cdot\textrm{year}_j + \varepsilon_{ij}
\end{equation}
$$

???
- or if a variable at some level moderates the effect of a variable at a different level
- [EXAMPLE] 
we have measured childrens' performance on a test over time, so we have multiple observations for each child. we can ask whether the slope of time (and there's a slope for each child) differs depending on whether the child is bilingual
- and this is really just an interaction, but one effect is at child level, and the other is at observation level

# Advantages of MLM

Multi-level models can be used to answer multi-level questions!  
<br><br>
Do random variances covary?  

__example:__  
Do children who score higher at the start of school show greater improvements than those who start lower?  

$$
\begin{align}
\textrm{score}_{ij} &= \beta_{0i} + \beta_{1i}\textrm{year}_j + \varepsilon_{ij} \\
\beta_{0i} &= \gamma_{00} + \zeta_{0i}\\
\beta_{1i} &= \gamma_{10} + \zeta_{1i}\\
\end{align}
$$
$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{bmatrix} \zeta_{0i} \\ \zeta_{1i} \end{bmatrix}
\sim N
\left(
    \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \sigma_0^2 & \rho \sigma_0 \sigma_1 \\
        \rho \sigma_0 \sigma_1 & \sigma_1^2
    \end{bmatrix}
\right)
\end{equation}
$$



???
- can also get more complicated
- in estimating variances of random effects, the model can also estimate covariances
- [EQUATION]
- allows us to ask about how cluster level deviations in one aspect correlate with cluster level deviations at others
- [EXAMPLE] we have measured childrens' performance on a test over time, and each child has their own intercept and their own slope. we might be interested in whether children who start higher increase more (have steeper slopes)

And we can see the clustering of our outcome variable, the emotion dysregulation scale, by different schools. These are just the distributions of children from each schools' scores, and we have an icc of .244, so we can say that roughly 24% of the variance in our outcome is explained by the clustering of schools.

- in the multilevel modelling approach, each school gets its own intercept and slope, but these 'borrow strength' from the others.   
- The borrowing of strength is more apparent for the (what would be) more extreme clusters, as well as those that have fewer datapoints. What happens to these cluster estimates is that they are shrunk towards the population average.

Note: ICC is conditional on zero values of random-effects covariates.

]

???
- recall that ICC is the proportion of variance between groups to the total variance.  
- we can get this from our lmer output!  
we're back to our childhood emotional dysregulation data here, and we can see that we have an estimated variance between schools, and the residual variance. between those, we can calculate the ratio of this to the total.  


Once we introduce random slopes/coefficients, things get more complicated. the ICC will be a function of the variable(s) for which random slopes are specified.

# Model Estimation

- For standard linear models, we can calculate the parameters using a *closed form solution*.


- Multilevel models are too complicated, we *estimate* all the parameters using an iterative procedure like Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

???
When it comes to how the parameters of our multilevel model are estimated, things can become more complicated. 
with simple linear regression models, there is one best set of values for our betas, which is the one that minimizes the sums of squared residuals, and these can be calculated algebraicially.  
but for multilevel models, which are considerably more complicated, we estimate the parameters using an iterative procedure like MLE

---
# Model Estimation: ML

Aim: find the values for the unknown parameters that maximize the probability of obtaining the observed data.  
How: This is done via finding values for the parameters that maximize the (log) likelihood function.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("jk_img_sandbox/1stderiv.png")
```

???
you might remember this idea from logistic regression models at the end of DAPR2. 
the idea here is that the process step-by-step finds values for the parameters that have the greatest likelihood, given the data we observed - i.e, those values that maxmimise the probability of observing our data. 

Although we can think of max likelihood estimation in terms of a reaching the apex of a curve, this only really applies in the estimation of a single parameter

---
count:false
# Model Estimation: (log)Likelihood

- Data = multiple observations: $1, ..., n$ 

- From our axioms of probability, we can combine these *i.i.d* by multiplication to get the likelihood of our parameters given our entire sample

- Instead of taking the **product** of the individual likelihoods, we can take the **summation** of the log-likelihoods
    - This is considerably easier to do, and can be achieved because multiplication is addition on a log scale.

---
# Model Estimation: ML

In multilevel models, our parameter space is more complex (e.g. both fixed effects and variance components).

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height="450px"}
knitr::include_graphics("jk_img_sandbox/multisurftb.png")
```

???
in complex models with many parameters, our optimisation algorithms are trying to find the high point of a hugely complex surface. 

---
# Model Estimation: Convergence


- Sometimes a model is too complex to be supported by the data

- Balancing act between simplifying our model while preserving attribution of variance to various sources  

- Get used to seeing lots of errors and warnings:  

<br>

```
warning(s): Model failed to converge with max|grad| = 0.0021777 (tol = 0.002, component 1) (and others)
```
<br>
```
message(s): boundary (singular) fit: see help('isSingular')
```


---
# Model Estimation: ML vs REML

TODO add more detail  
- Standard ML results in biased estimates of variance components (esp. for small samples).

- Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) is the default in `lmer()`.

    - REML separates the estimation of fixed and random parts of the model, leading to less biased estimates of the variance components.  

???
in simple regression, it is rarely variance estimates that are of interest - rather, we are often focussed on the coefficients.  
but in multilevel models were are more often specifically interested in estimated variance of our random effects. 

an adaptation called REML can be used in which estimation of the random parts is done assuming the fixed parts to be known. 
sort of like estimating the fixed effects first and then the variance components.

this can lead to less biased estimates of our random effect variances

we have data from some participants - here's our participant identifier, and each one has 10 visits, and a score at each visit.

we can plot our data as a line for each participant, and see the overall pattern. 


---
# Longitudinal Example: Model Spec

__fixef effects__  

"cognition over time" = `cog ~ visit_n`  


__random effect structure__

- multiple data-points per participant: **1 | participant**

???
let's think about what our random effect structure might look like. we have several observations for each participant, and we might expect scores to vary between participants. so we'll fit a random intercept. 

--

- explanatory variable of interest (`visit_n`) varies *within* participants: **visit_n | participant**

???
our independent variable, visit_n, is also likely to vary between participants. some participants will decline slower, or faster, than others. 


--

- allow by-participant intercepts to correlate with by-participant slopes: **1 + visit_n | participant**  
(more on this in future weeks)

???
we'll also allow our random intercepts and slopes to correlate. we'll touch on this more in future weeks, but the default for lme4 is to allow random effects to covary. essentially, this means that we model a parameter to account for the extent that people's intercepts and slopes are correlated, for instance, people who start higher might decline less steeply,

__fitting the model__

```{r}

again, participants vary around this estimate, some have less decline, some have more.

# Summary

- We can extend our linear model equation to model certain parameters as random cluster-level adjustments around a fixed center.

- $\color{red}{y_i} = \color{blue}{\beta_0 \cdot{} 1 \; + \; \beta_1 \cdot{} x_{i} } + \varepsilon_i$  
becomes  
$\color{red}{y_{ij}} = \color{blue}{\beta_{0i} \cdot 1 + \beta_{1i} \cdot x_{ij}} + \varepsilon_{ij}$  
$\color{blue}{\beta_{0i}} = \gamma_{00} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}}$

- We can express this as one equation if we prefer:
$\color{red}{y_{ij}} = \underbrace{(\gamma_{00} + \color{orange}{\zeta_{0i}})}_{\color{blue}{\beta_{0i}}} \cdot 1 +  \color{blue}{\beta_{1i} \cdot x_{ij}}  +  \varepsilon_{ij}$

- This allows us to model cluster-level variation around the intercept ("random intercept") and around slopes ("random slope"). 

- We can fit this using the **lme4** package in R

???
okay, let's take stock before we have a longer break. 
we've covered extending linear model equations to have equations specified at multiple levels, packaged in these parentheses if you prefer. 
what this allowed us to do, using the lme4 package, is model group or cluster level variation in our effects, and we talked briefly about how this has certain advantages such as the idea of more extreme clusters and more sparse clusters, being shrunk towards the average effect. 

we've also seen some of the questions that this allows us to answer. we used the children in schools example to discuss how we might ask whether school level predictors influence things that happen at the child level.

okay, let's talk about inference in multilevel models. 
this is a thorny issue, and there are a lot papers on the topic.
what we're aiming for is to have a broad overview of why it's a tricky issue, cover some of the options we have, and make a recommendation on which approach might be the most reliable to use.

you will have probably noticed when we were discussing the output of an lmer() object, that we don't get any p-values.

# Why no p-values?

**Extensive debate about how best to test parameters from MLMs.**  

???
there is a lot of debate on how we should be conducting inferential tests from multilevel models. 

--

In simple LM, we test the reduction in residual SS (sums of squares), which follows an $F$ distribution with a known $df$.
$$
\begin{align}
F \qquad = \qquad \frac{MS_{model}}{MS_{residual}} \qquad = \qquad \frac{SS_{model}/df_{model}}{SS_{residual}/df_{residual}} \\
\quad \\
df_{model} = k \\
df_{residual} = n-k-1 \\
\end{align}
$$
???
when we learned about standard linear model in DAPR2, tests were conducted on the reduction in sums of squared residuals, which follow an F distribution with k and n-k-1 degrees of freedom

--

The $t$-statistic for a coefficient in a simple regression model is the square root of $F$ ratio between models with and without that parameter. 

- Such $F$ will have 1 numerator degree of freedom (and $n-k-1$ denominator degrees of freedom).
- The analogous $t$-distribution has $n-k-1$ degrees of freedom

???
the t-statistics of the coefficients were tested against t distributions with n-k-1 degrees of freedom accordingly. 

---
# Why no p-values?

In MLM, the distribution of a test statistic when the null hypothesis is true is **unknown.**

???
in multilevel models, the distribution of our test statistics is often unknown. remember that we cannot solve our equations here and find the parameter estimates algebraically to minimise residual sums of squares, but instead we find the best estimates via max likelihood. 

--

Under very specific conditions (normally distributed outcome variable, perfectly balanced designs), we can separate out sums of squares to calculate $F$, and hence can use an $F$ distribution and correctly determine the denominator $df$.  

But for most situations:
  - unclear how to calculate denominator $df$
  - unclear whether the test statistics even follow an $F$ distribution
  
???
In all but the most controlled experimental designs, it is unclear how to calculate the denominator degrees of freedom in order to perform the relevant test.

# Options for inference

1. df approximations  

2. Likelihood Ratio Tests  

3. Bootstrap

There are three main approaches to drawing inferences from multilevel models.

# Likelihood ratio tests

- Compares the log-likelihood of two competing models.  

- remember "likelihood" = a function that associates to a parameter the probability (or probability density) of observing the given sample data. 

- ratio of two likelihoods is **asymptotically** $\chi^2$-square distributed.

    - *this means for small samples (at any "levels") it may be unreliable*

```{r}
restricted_model <- lmer(cog ~ 1 + 
                           (1 + visit_n | participant),

# Bootstrap

- Parametric Bootstrap  
  assumes that explanatory variables are fixed and that model specification and the distributions such as $\zeta_i \sim N(0,\sigma_{\zeta})$ and $\varepsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma_{\varepsilon})$ are correct.
  
- Case-based Bootstrap  
  minimal assumptions - we just need to ensure that we correctly specify the hierarchical dependency of data.  
  requires decision of at which levels to resample.  
  (discussed more next week)


???

What we are going to focus on here is bootstrapping multilevel models.  
There are various different ways we can bootstrap, which vary in the assumptions they make about our model and about the process that generates our data.  
Today we'll focus on parametric bootstrapping. This assumes that our model is correct, for instance, in that our residuals and our random effect terms are normally distributed. 

---
# Parametric Bootstrap

The basic premise is that we:  

1. fit model(s) to data

2. Do many times:

  - simulate data based on the parameters of the fitted model(s)
  - compute some statistic/estimates from the simulated data

3. Construct a distribution of possible values

# Summary

- Lots of debate around how best to conduct statistical inferences based on multi-level models. 

- Lots of options:

  - approximations for $df$: _easy to implement. generally reliable. debate as to whether null is actually F. distribution_  
      - fit `lmer()` with package **lmerTest**   
      - `KRmodcomp(mod2, mod1)` from package **pbkrtest**  
      
  - likelihood ratio tests: _very quick, but best avoided unless big $n$ at all levels_  
      - `anova(mod1, mod2)`   
      
  - parametric bootstrap: _time consuming, but probably most reliable option (although can be problematic with unstable models)_  
      - `PBmodcomp(mod2, mod1)` from package **pbkrtest**    
      - `confint(mod, method="boot")`   
      


???
In summary then, making statistical inferences from multilevel models is a difficult, and slightly contentious issue. 
There are various approaches that we can use, many of which have certain drawbacks, such as requiring perfectly balanced designs, or being less reliable with small sample sizes. 
ultimately, the decision is yours to make - you may find conducting standard likelihood ratio tests, using the anova function, are more convenient as they do not take much time to compute, but we would recommend a bootstrapping approach as being worth the extra little bit of time.
