    "text": "This is optional for the DAPR3 course, but may be useful for your dissertations should your field/supervisor prefer the ANOVA framework to that of the linear model.\nThis walks briefly through these models with the ez package. There are many other packages available, and many good tutorials online should you desire extra resources in the future:\n\nhttps://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/repeated-measures-anova-in-r\nhttps://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/04/repeated-measures-of-anova-in-r-complete-tutorial/\nhttps://stats.idre.ucla.edu/r/seminars/repeated-measures-analysis-with-r/\nhttps://www.datanovia.com/en/lessons/mixed-anova-in-r/\n\n\n\nData: Audio interference in executive functioning\nThis data is from a simulated study that aims to investigate the following research questions:\n\nHow do different types of audio interfere with executive functioning, and does this interference differ depending upon whether or not noise-cancelling headphones are used?\n\n24 healthy volunteers each completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) - a commonly used test to assess processing speed and motor speed - a total of 15 times. During the tests, participants listened to either no audio (5 tests), white noise (5 tests) or classical music (5 tests). Half the participants listened via active-noise-cancelling headphones, and the other half listened via speakers in the room.\nThe data is in stored in two separate files - the research administering the tests recorded the SDMT score in one spreadsheet, while details of the audio used in the experiment are held in a separate sheet\n\nInformation about the audio condition for each trial of each participant is stored in .csv format at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/ef_music.csv.

So for now we will ignore the headphones variable.\n\n\nCode\nhead(efdata)\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  PID    trial_n  audio       headphones  SDMT\n  &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 PPT_01 Trial_02 no_audio    speakers      31\n2 PPT_01 Trial_08 no_audio    speakers      23\n3 PPT_01 Trial_11 no_audio    speakers      23\n4 PPT_01 Trial_13 no_audio    speakers      24\n5 PPT_01 Trial_15 no_audio    speakers      34\n6 PPT_01 Trial_01 white_noise speakers      38\n\n\nThe easiest way to conduct a repeated measures ANOVA in R is to use the ez package, which comes with some handy functions to visualise the experimental design.\nWe can see from below that every participant completed 5 trials for each type of audio interference:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ez)\nezDesign(data = efdata, x = audio, y = PID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ezANOVA() function takes a few arguments.\nThe ones you will need for this are:\n\ndata the name of the dataframe\ndv the column name for the dependent variable\nwid the column name for the participant id variable\nwithin the column name(s) for the predictor variable(s) that vary within participants\nbetween the column name(s) for any predictor variable(s) that vary between participants\n\nFit a repeated measures ANOVA to examine the effect of the audio type on SDMT:\n\n\nCode\nezANOVA(data = efdata, dv = SDMT, wid = PID, within = audio)\n\n\n$ANOVA\n  Effect DFn DFd        F            p p&lt;.05       ges\n2  audio   2  46 44.69618 1.647271e-11     * 0.2534633\n\n$`Mauchly's Test for Sphericity`\n  Effect         W          p p&lt;.05\n2  audio 0.8105961 0.09927715      \n\n$`Sphericity Corrections`\n  Effect       GGe      p[GG] p[GG]&lt;.05      HFe        p[HF] p[HF]&lt;.05\n2  audio 0.8407573 5.0677e-10         * 0.899603 1.427119e-10         *\n\n\n\n\nMixed ANOVA\nMixed ANOVA can be used to investigate effects of independent variables that are at two different levels, i.e. some are within clusters and some are between.\n\nDoes the effect of audio interference on executive functioning differ depending upon whether or not noise-cancelling headphones are used?\n\nLook at the two lines below. Can you work out what the plots will look like before you run them?\n\n\nCode\nezDesign(data = efdata, x = headphones, y = PID)\nezDesign(data = efdata, x = headphones, y = audio)\n\n\nParticipants 1-20 are in one condition, and 21-40 are in another.\nThis should look like a two big blocks on the diagonal.\n\n\nCode\nezDesign(data = efdata, x = headphones, y = PID)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn each condition, all different types of audio were observed in the same number of trials.

If you have an error message in R, copy the error message into google. The results returned can sometimes just cause more confusion, but sometimes something might jump out at you and help you solve the problem. The same applies with searching the internet for help with statistics - search for “what is a p-value”, and you’ll find many many different articles and forum discussions etc. Some of them you will find too technical, but don’t be scared - the vast majority of people work in statistics will find these too technical too. Some of them you might feel are too simple/not helpful. As a general guide, keep clicking around the search responses, and you may end up finding that someone, somewhere, has provided an explanation at the right level. If you find something during your search which you don’t quite understand, feel free to link it in a post on the discussion forum!"

    "text": "Likelihood\nFor likelihood, we are interested in hypotheses about our coin. Do we think it is a fair coin (for which the probability of heads is 0.5?).\nTo consider these hypotheses, we need to observe some data, and so we need to have a given number of tosses, and a given number of heads. Whereas above we varied the number of heads, and fixed the parameter that designates the true chance of landing on heads for any given toss, for the likelihood we fix the number of heads observed, and can make statements about different possible parameters that might govern the coins behaviour.\nFor example, if we did observe 2 heads in 8 tosses, what is the likelihood of this data given various parameters?\nOur parameter can take any real number between from 0 to 1, but let’s do it for a selection:\n\nposs_parameters = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05)\ndbinom(2, 8, poss_parameters)\n\n [1] 0.000000e+00 5.145643e-02 1.488035e-01 2.376042e-01 2.936013e-01\n [6] 3.114624e-01 2.964755e-01 2.586868e-01 2.090189e-01 1.569492e-01\n[11] 1.093750e-01 7.033289e-02 4.128768e-02 2.174668e-02 1.000188e-02\n[16] 3.845215e-03 1.146880e-03 2.304323e-04 2.268000e-05 3.948437e-07\n[21] 0.000000e+00\n\n\nSo what we are doing here is considering the possible parameters that govern our coin. Given that we observed 2 heads in 8 coin tosses, it seems very unlikely that the coin weighted such that it lands on heads 80% of the time (e.g., the parameter of 0.8 is not likely). You can visualise this as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormalizing the intuition We have a stochastic process that takes discrete values (i.e. outcomes of tossing a coin 10 times). We calculated the probability of observing a particular set of outcomes (8 correct predictions) by making assumptions about the underlying stochastic process, that is, the probability that our test subject can correctly predict the outcome of the coin toss is (p) (e.g. 0.8). We also assumed implicitly that the coin tosses are independent."
