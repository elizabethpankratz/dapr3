This week, we’re going to explore what that means.\nThroughout this course, we will tend to use the terms “mixed effect model”, “linear mixed model (LMM)” and “multilevel model (MLM)” interchangeably."

This is most easily seen when the model includes a categorical variable as a predictor. The summary() function would return, for each level of the predictor (excluding the reference level), a coefficient, its standard error, the t-statistic, and the p-value for a test of whether the coefficient is significantly different from 0. A model comparison between that model and a null model without the categorical predictor would collapse all levels into a single test across all levels of the predictor.↩︎"

    "text": "Exercises: Assumptions & Diagnostics\n\nData: Wellbeing Across Scotland\nFor these next set of exercises we continue with our recurring study in which researchers want to look at the relationship between time spent outdoors and mental wellbeing, across all of Scotland. Data is collected from 20 of the Local Authority Areas and is accessible at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    ppt\nParticipant ID\n    name\nParticipant Name\n    laa\nLocal Authority Area\n    outdoor_time\nSelf report estimated number of hours per week spent outdoors\n    wellbeing\nWarwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a self-report measure of mental health and well-being. The scale is scored by summing responses to each item, with items answered on a 1 to 5 Likert scale. The minimum scale score is 14 and the maximum is 70.\n    density\nLAA Population Density (people per square km)\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nThe code below will read in the data and fit the model with by-LAA random intercepts and slopes of outdoor time.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lme4)\nscotmw &lt;- read_csv(\"https://uoepsy.github.io/data/LAAwellbeing.csv\")\nrs_model &lt;- lmer(wellbeing ~ 1 + outdoor_time + (1 + outdoor_time | laa), data = scotmw)\n\n\nPlot the residuals vs fitted values, and assess the extend to which the assumption holds that the residuals are zero mean.\nConstruct a scale-location plot. This is where the square-root of the absolute value of the standardised residuals is plotted against the fitted values, and allows you to more easily assess the assumption of constant variance.\n\n\nOptional: can you create the same plot using ggplot, starting with the augment() function from the broom.mixed package?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(model) will give you this plot, but you might want to play with the type = c(......) argument to get the smoothing line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nplot(rs_model, type=c(\"p\",\"smooth\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the mean value of the residuals is quite close to zero, right the way across the fitted values. This is good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo change labels for the x and y axes, add the following arguments to the plot() function:\n\nxlab = \"Fitted values\"\nylab = \"Residuals\"\n\n\n\n\nplot(rs_model,\n     form = sqrt(abs(resid(.))) ~ fitted(.),\n     type = c(\"p\",\"smooth\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this plot we can see that the variance of the residuals is fairly constant across the fitted values. There is a slight dip at the lower end. We can see this in the previous plot too - all the points at the LHS of the plot are slightly more tightly grouped around the line. This is not enough to worry me, personally.\n\nlibrary(broom.mixed)\naugment(rs_model) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    sqrtr = sqrt(abs(.resid))\n  ) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x=.fitted, y=sqrtr)) + \n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo remove the confidence bands (in grey) from the smoothed line, you can change the last command to:\ngeom_smooth(se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nExamine the normality of both the level 1 and level 2 residuals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse hist() if you like, or qqnorm(residuals) followed by qqline(residuals)\nExtracting the level 2 residuals (the random effects) can be difficult. ranef(model) will get you some of the way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nLevel 1\n\nhist(resid(rs_model))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqqnorm(resid(rs_model))\nqqline(resid(rs_model))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nIndexing random effects\nThe output of ranef() is a type of data container called “list”. The list includes different named slots and you can find the names as follows:\n\nnames(ranef(rs_model))\n\n[1] \"laa\"\n\n\nYou have a named slot for each group in your lmer specification. In this case, we only specified laa as grouping. To access the random effects for the specific group, type ranef(model) followed by $groupname\n\nranef(rs_model)$laa\n\n                      (Intercept) outdoor_time\nAngus                  -4.8568066  0.095850303\nArgyll and Bute         1.6488121 -0.005181049\nCity of Edinburgh      10.8163125  0.199034174\nDumfries and Galloway  -2.6893688 -0.012005965\nEast Ayrshire          -5.6749200 -0.232750990\nEast Renfrewshire       0.5024800  0.084907037\nFalkirk                -7.4525578 -0.156694328\nGlasgow City          -10.9101439 -0.464232183\nHighland                6.7315989  0.280992008\nInverclyde             -1.2966048  0.197142062\nMidlothian             -1.7585791 -0.485961786\nMoray                  -2.2165380  0.133392034\nNa h-Eileanan Siar     14.0595006  0.399493656\nOrkney Islands          0.1789928  0.154590585\nPerth and Kinross       1.4894924  0.256689754\nScottish Borders       -0.2638474 -0.148174460\nShetland Islands        4.7262680  0.388873631\nStirling                6.5060959 -0.075781592\nWest Dunbartonshire    -6.4127140 -0.266515096\nWest Lothian           -3.1274727 -0.343667797\n\n\nYou will have multiple columns, one for each random effect.\nYou can get the random intercepts by laa, by selecting the first column as follows:\n\nranef(rs_model)$laa[, 1]\n\n [1]  -4.8568066   1.6488121  10.8163125  -2.6893688  -5.6749200   0.5024800\n [7]  -7.4525578 -10.9101439   6.7315989  -1.2966048  -1.7585791  -2.2165380\n[13]  14.0595006   0.1789928   1.4894924  -0.2638474   4.7262680   6.5060959\n[19]  -6.4127140  -3.1274727\n\n\nRespectively, for the random slopes by laa, you select the second column as follows:\n\nranef(rs_model)$laa[, 2]\n\n [1]  0.095850303 -0.005181049  0.199034174 -0.012005965 -0.232750990\n [6]  0.084907037 -0.156694328 -0.464232183  0.280992008  0.197142062\n[11] -0.485961786  0.133392034  0.399493656  0.154590585  0.256689754\n[16] -0.148174460  0.388873631 -0.075781592 -0.266515096 -0.343667797\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel 2\n\nqqnorm(ranef(rs_model)$laa[, 1], main = \"Random intercept\")\nqqline(ranef(rs_model)$laa[, 1])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nqqnorm(ranef(rs_model)$laa[, 2], main = \"Random slope\")\nqqline(ranef(rs_model)$laa[, 2])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normality of the residuals at both levels looks pretty decent here.

Once a week for 5 consecutive weeks, participants were asked to complete two questionnaires, one assessing their level of hunger, and one assessing their level of irritability. The time and day at which participants were assessed was at a randomly chosen hour between 7am and 7pm each week. 46 of the participants were following a five-two diet (five days of normal eating, 2 days of fasting), and the remaining 35 were following no specific diet.\nThe data are available at: https://uoepsy.github.io/data/hangry.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nq_irritability\nScore on irritability questionnaire (0:100)\n\n\nq_hunger\nScore on hunger questionnaire (0:100)\n\n\nppt\nParticipant\n\n\nfivetwo\nWhether the participant follows the five-two diet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nRead carefully the description of the study above, and try to write out (in lmer syntax) an appropriate model to test the research aims.\ne.g.:\noutcome ~ explanatory variables + (???? | grouping)\nTry to think about the maximal random effect structure (i.e. everything that can vary by-grouping is estimated as doing so).\nTo help you think through the steps to get from a description of a research study to a model specification, think about your answers to the following questions.\nQ: What is our outcome variable?\nQ: What are our explanatory variables?\nQ: Is there any grouping (or “clustering”) of our data that we consider to be a random sample? If so, what are the groups?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe research is looking at how hunger influences irritability, and whether this is different for people on the fivetwo diet.\nWe can split our data in to groups of each participant. We can also split it into groups of each diet. Which of these groups have we randomly sampled? Do we have a random sample of participants? Do we have a random sample of diets? Another way to think of this is “if i repeated the experiment, what these groups be different?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nOur outcome is irritability here, because it is the thing that we are trying to explain through peoples’ hunger levels and diets.\n\nlmer(irritability ~  explanatory variables + (???? | grouping))\n\nWe are interested in the effect of hunger on irritability, and whether this effect is different for the five-two diet. So we are interested in the interaction:\n\nlmer(irritability ~  hunger + diet + hunger:diet + (???? | grouping))\n\n(remember that hunger + diet + hunger:diet is just a more explicit way of writing hunger*diet).\nIf we did this experiment again, would we have different participants?\nYes. If we did this experiment again, would we have different diets? No, because we’re interested in the specific differences between the five-two diet and no dieting. This means we will likely want to by-participant random deviations (e.g. the ( ... | participant) bit in lmer). But we won’t have by-diet random effects (1 | diet) because the diet differences are the specific differences that we wish to test.\n\nlmer(irritability ~  hunger + diet + hunger:diet + (???? | participant))\n\nThinking about what can be modelled as randomly varying between participants, we have some options:\n\nparticipants vary in how irritable they are on average\n(the intercept, 1 | participant)\nparticipants vary in how much hunger influences their irritability\n(the effect of hunger, hunger | participant)\nparticipants vary in how much diet influences irritability\n(the effect of diet, diet | participant)\nparticipants vary in how much diet effects hunger’s influence on irritability\n(the interaction between diet and hunger, diet:hunger | participant)\n\nWe can vary 1 and 2, but not 3 and 4. This is because each participant is either following the five-two diet or they are not. So for a single participant, we can’t assess “the effect diet has” on anything, because we haven’t seen that participant under different diets. if we try to plot a single participants’ data, we can see that it is impossible for us to assess “the effect of diet”:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy contrast, we can vary the intercept and the effect of hunger, because each participant has multiple values of irritability, and multiple different observations of hunger. We can think about a single participant’s “effect of hunger on irritability” and how we might fit a line to their data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlmer(irritability ~  hunger + diet + hunger:diet + (1 + hunger | participant))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal, Within, Between\n\n\n\n\n\nRecall our research aim:\n\n… whether hunger influences peoples’ levels of irritability (i.e., “the hangry hypothesis”), and whether this is different for people following a diet that includes fasting.\n\nForgetting about any differences due to diet, let’s just think about the relationship between irritability and hunger. How should we interpret this research aim?\nWas it:\n\n“Are people more irritable if they are, on average, more hungry than other people?”\n\n“Are people more irritable if they are, for them, more hungry than they usually are?”\n\nSome combination of both a. and b.\n\nThis is just one demonstration of how the statistical methods we use can constitute an integral part of our development of a research project, and part of the reason that data analysis for scientific cannot be so easily outsourced after designing the study and collecting the data.\nAs our data currently is currently stored, the relationship between irritability and the raw scores on the hunger questionnaire q_hunger represents some ‘total effect’ of hunger on irritability. This is a bit like interpretation c. above - it’s a composite of both the ‘within’ ( b. ) and ‘between’ ( a. ) effects. The problem with this is that the ‘total effect’ isn’t necessarily all that meaningful. It may tell us that ‘being higher on the hunger questionnaire is associated with being more irritable’, but how can we apply this information? It is not specifically about the comparison between hungry people and less hungry people, and nor is it about how person i changes when they are more hungry than usual. It is both these things smushed together.\nTo disaggregate the ‘within’ and ‘between’ effects of hunger on irritability, we can group-mean center. For ‘between’, we are interested in how irritability is related to the average hunger levels of a participant, and for ‘within’, we are asking how irritability is related to a participants’ relative levels of hunger (i.e., how far above/below their average hunger level they are.).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nAdd to the data these two columns:\n\na column which contains the average hungriness score for each participant.\na column which contains the deviation from each person’s hunger score to that person’s average hunger score.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll find group_by() %&gt;% mutate() very useful here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nhangry &lt;- \n    hangry %&gt;% group_by(ppt) %&gt;%\n        mutate(\n            avg_hunger = mean(q_hunger),\n            hunger_gc = q_hunger - avg_hunger\n        )\nhead(hangry)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n# Groups:   ppt [2]\n  q_irritability q_hunger ppt   fivetwo avg_hunger hunger_gc\n           &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1             17       30 N1p1  1             26.6     3.4  \n2             19       27 N1p1  1             26.6     0.400\n3             19       29 N1p1  1             26.6     2.4  \n4             20       33 N1p1  1             26.6     6.4  \n5             24       14 N1p1  1             26.6   -12.6  \n6             30       28 N1p2  1             32.6    -4.6  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nFor each of the new variables you just added, plot the irritability scores against those variables.\n\nDoes it look like hungry people are more irritable than less hungry people?\n\nDoes it look like when people are more hungry than normal, they are more irritable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nWe might find it easier to look at a plot where each participant is represented as their mean plus an indication of their range of irritability scores:\n\nggplot(hangry,aes(x=avg_hunger,y=q_irritability))+\n    stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a slight positive relationship between a persons’ average hunger and their irritability scores.\nIt is harder to tell what the relationship is between participant-centered hunger and irritability, because there are a lot of different lines (one for each participant). To make it easier to get an idea of what’s happening, we’ll make the plot fit a simple lm() (a straight line) for each participants’ data:\n\nggplot(hangry,aes(x=hunger_gc,y=q_irritability, color=ppt)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = .2) + \n  geom_smooth(method=lm, se=FALSE, lwd=.2) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'none')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think there might be a positive trend in here, in that participants tend to be higher irritability when they are higher (for them) on the hunger score.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nWe have taken the raw hunger scores and separated them into two parts (raw hunger scores = participants’ average hunger score + observation level deviations from those averages), that represent two different aspects of the relationship between hunger and irritability.\nAdjust your model specification to include these two separate variables as predictors, instead of the raw hunger scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhunger * diet could be replaced by (hunger1 + hunger2) * diet, thereby allowing each aspect of hunger to interact with diet.\nWe can only put one of these variables in the random effects (1 + hunger | participant). Recall that above we discussed how we cannot have (diet | participant), because “an effect of diet” makes no sense for a single participant (they are either on the diet or they are not, so there is no ‘effect’). Similarly, each participant has only one value for their average hungriness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(lme4)\nhangrywb &lt;- lmer(q_irritability ~ (avg_hunger + hunger_gc)* fivetwo + \n                (1 + hunger_gc | ppt), \n                data = hangry,\n                control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nHopefully, you have fitted a model similar to the below:\n\nhangrywb &lt;- lmer(q_irritability ~ (avg_hunger + hunger_gc) * fivetwo + \n                (1 + hunger_gc | ppt), data = hangry,\n            control = lmerControl(optimizer=\"bobyqa\"))\n\nBelow, we have obtained p-values using the Kenward Rogers Approximation of \\(df\\) for the test of whether the fixed effects are zero, so we can see the significance of each estimate.\nProvide an answer for each of these questions:\n\nFor those following no diet, is there evidence to suggest that people who are on average more hungry are more irritable?\nIs there evidence to suggest that this is different for those following the five-two diet?

There is no evidence (\\(p&gt;.05\\)) to suggest that when not dieting, hungrier people are more irritable than less hungry people.\n2: Is there evidence to suggest that this is different for those following the five-two diet? In what way?\nA: This is the interaction between avg_hunger:fivetwo1. We can see that, for every increase of 1 in average hunger, irritability is estimated to increase by 0.47 more for those in the five-two diet than it does for those following no diet.\nThese units are still in terms of the original scale (i.e. 0 to 100).\n3: Do people following no diet tend to be more irritable when they are more hungry than they usually are? A: This is the estimate for the coefficient of hunger_gc. For people following no diet, there is an estimated 0.19 increase in irritability for every 1 unit more hungry they become.\n4: Is there evidence to suggest that this is different for those following the five-two diet? In what way? A: This effect of a 1 unit change on within-person hunger increasing irritability is increased for those who are following the five-two diet by an additional 0.38\n5: What does the fivetwo1 coefficient represent? A: This represents the group difference of irritability between those on the five-two diet vs those not dieting, for someone who has an average hunger score of 0.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nConstruct two plots showing the two model estimated interactions. Think about your answers to the previous question, and check that they match with what you are seeing in the plots (do not underestimate the utility of this activity for helping understanding!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThis isn’t as difficult as it sounds. the sjPlot package can do it in one line of code!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(sjPlot)\nplot_model(hangrywb, type = \"int\")[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe saw in the model coefficients that for the reference level of fivetwo, the “No Diet” group, there was no association between how hungry a person is on average and their irritability. This is the red line we see in the plot above. We also saw the interaction avg_hunger:fivetwo1 indicates that irritability is estimated to increase by 0.47 more for those in the five-two diet than it does for those following no diet. So the blue line is should be going up more steeply than the red line (which is flat). And it is!\n\nplot_model(hangrywb, type = \"int\")[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the coefficient of hunger_gc we get the estimated amount by which irritability increases for every 1 more hungry that a person becomes (when they’re on “No Diet”). This is the slope of the red line. The interaction hunger_gc:fivetwo1 gave us the adjustment to get from the red line to the blue line. It is positive and significant, which matches with the fact that the blue line is clearly steeper in this plot.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nProvide tests or confidence intervals for the parameters of interest, and write-up the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember: some options for inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf approximations\nlikelihood-based\n\n\n\n\ntests or CIs for model parameters\nlibrary(parameters)model_parameters(model, ci_method=\"kr\")\nconfint(model, type=\"profile\")\n\n\nmodel comparison(different fixed effects, same random effects)\nlibrary(pbkrtest)KRmodcomp(model1,model0)\nanova(model0,model)\n\n\n\nfit models with REML=TRUE.good option for small samples\nfit models with REML=FALSE.needs large N at both levels (40+)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(parameters)\nmodel_parameters(hangrywb, ci_method = \"kr\", ci_random = FALSE)\n\n# Fixed Effects\n\nParameter                | Coefficient |   SE |          95% CI |     t |    df |      p\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Intercept)              |       17.13 | 5.21 | [  6.75, 27.51] |  3.29 | 77.00 | 0.002 \navg hunger               |    3.86e-03 | 0.11 | [ -0.21,  0.22] |  0.04 | 77.00 | 0.971 \nhunger gc                |        0.19 | 0.08 | [  0.03,  0.34] |  2.45 | 70.40 | 0.017 \nfivetwo [1]              |      -10.85 | 6.62 | [-24.03,  2.32] | -1.64 | 77.00 | 0.105 \navg hunger × fivetwo [1] |        0.47 | 0.14 | [  0.20,  0.74] |  3.44 | 77.00 | &lt; .001\nhunger gc × fivetwo [1]  |        0.38 | 0.10 | [  0.18,  0.58] |  3.75 | 73.64 | &lt; .001\n\n# Random Effects\n\nParameter                      | Coefficient\n--------------------------------------------\nSD (Intercept: ppt)            |        6.93\nSD (hunger_gc: ppt)            |        0.38\nCor (Intercept~hunger_gc: ppt) |       -0.01\nSD (Residual)                  |        4.83\n\n\nTo investigate the association between irritability and hunger, and whether this relationship is different depending on whether or not participants are on a restricted diet such as the five-two, a multilevel linear model was fitted.\nTo disaggregate between the differences in irritability due to people being in general more/less hungry, and those due to people being more/less hungry than usual for them, irritability was regressed onto both participants’ average hunger scores their relative hunger levels. Both of these were allowed to interact with whether or not participants were on the five-two diet. Random intercepts and slopes of relative-hunger level were included for participants. The model was fitting with restricted maximum likelihood estimation with the lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015), using the bobyqa optimiser from the lme4. \\(P\\)-values were obtained using Wald tests with Kenward-Roger approximation of denominator degrees of freedom.\nResults indicate that for people on no diet, being more hungry than normal was associated with greater irritability (\\(\\beta = 0.19,\\ SE = 0.08,\\ t(2.45) = 70.4,\\ p=0.017\\)), and that this was increased for those following the five-two diet (\\(\\beta = 0.38,\\ SE = 0.1,\\ t(3.75) = 73.64,\\ p&lt;0.001\\)). Although for those not on a specific diet there was no evidence for an association between irritability and being generally a more hungry person (\\(p=0.971\\)), there a significant interaction was found between average hunger and being on the five-two diet (\\(\\beta = 0.47,\\ SE = 0.14,\\ t(3.44) = 77,\\ p&lt;0.001\\)), suggesting that when dieting, hungrier people tend to be more irritable than less hungry people.\nResults suggest that the ‘hangry hypothesis’ may occur within people (when a person is more hungry than they usually are, they tend to be more irritable), but not necessarily between hungry/less hungry people. Dieting was found to increase the association of both between-person hunger and within-person hunger with irritability.\n\n\n\n\nOther within-group transformations\nAs well as within-group mean centering a predictor (like we have done above), we can within-group standardise a predictor. This would disagregate within and between effects, but interpretation would of the within effect would be the estimated change in \\(y\\) associated with being 1 standard deviation higher in \\(x\\) for that group."

    "text": "Flashcards: lm to lmer\nIn a simple linear regression, there is only considered to be one source of random variability: any variability left unexplained by a set of predictors (which are modelled as fixed estimates) is captured in the model residuals.\nMulti-level (or ‘mixed-effects’) approaches involve modelling more than one source of random variability - as well as variance resulting from taking a random sample of observations, we can identify random variability across different groups of observations. For example, if we are studying a patient population in a hospital, we would expect there to be variability across the our sample of patients, but also across the doctors who treat them.\nWe can account for this variability by allowing the outcome to be lower/higher for each group (a random intercept) and by allowing the estimated effect of a predictor vary across groups (random slopes).\n\nBefore you expand each of the boxes below, think about how comfortable you feel with each concept.\nThis content is very cumulative, which means often going back to try to isolate the place which we need to focus efforts in learning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimple Linear Regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula:\n\n\\(y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i\\)\n\nR command:\n\nlm(outcome ~ predictor, data = dataframe)\n\nNote: this is the same as lm(outcome ~ 1 + predictor, data = dataframe). The 1 + is always there unless we specify otherwise (e.g., by using 0 +).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustered (multi-level) data\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen our data is clustered (or ‘grouped’) such that datapoints are no longer independent, but belong to some grouping such as that of multiple observations from the same subject, we have multiple sources of random variability. A simple regression does not capture this.\nIf we separate out our data to show an individual plot for each grouping (in this data the grouping is by subjects), we can see how the fitted regression line from lm() is assumed to be the same for each group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom intercepts\n\n\n\n\n\nBy including a random-intercept term, we are letting our model estimate random variability around an average parameter (represented by the fixed effects) for the clusters.\n\nFormula:\nLevel 1:\n\n\\(y_{ij} = \\beta_{0i} + \\beta_{1i} x_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\)\n\nLevel 2:\n\n\\(\\beta_{0i} = \\gamma_{00} + \\zeta_{0i}\\)\n\nWhere the expected values of \\(\\zeta_{0}\\), and \\(\\epsilon\\) are 0, and their variances are \\(\\sigma_{0}^2\\) and \\(\\sigma_\\epsilon^2\\) respectively. We will further assume that these are normally distributed.\nWe can now see that the intercept estimate \\(\\beta_{0i}\\) for a particular group \\(i\\) is represented by the combination of a mean estimate for the parameter (\\(\\gamma_{00}\\)) and a random effect for that group (\\(\\zeta_{0i}\\)).\nR command:\n\nlmer(outcome ~ predictor + (1 | grouping), data = dataframe)\n\n\nNotice how the fitted line of the random intercept model has an adjustment for each subject.\nEach subject’s line has been moved up or down accordingly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShrinkage\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you think about it, we might have done a similar thing to the random intercept with the tools we already had at our disposal, by using lm(y~x+subject). This would give us a coefficient for the difference between each subject and the reference level intercept, or we could extend this to lm(y~x*subject) to give us an adjustment to the slope for each subject.\nHowever, the estimate of these models will be slightly different:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy? One of the benefits of multi-level models is that our cluster-level estimates are shrunk towards the average depending on a) the level of across-cluster variation and b) the number of datapoints in clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandom slopes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormula:\nLevel 1:\n\n\\(y_{ij} = \\beta_{0i} + \\beta_{1i} x_{ij} + \\epsilon_{ij}\\)\n\nLevel 2:\n\n\\(\\beta_{0i} = \\gamma_{00} + \\zeta_{0i}\\)\n\n\\(\\beta_{1i} = \\gamma_{10} + \\zeta_{1i}\\)\n\nWhere the expected values of \\(\\zeta_0\\), \\(\\zeta_1\\), and \\(\\epsilon\\) are 0, and their variances are \\(\\sigma_{0}^2\\), \\(\\sigma_{1}^2\\), \\(\\sigma_\\epsilon^2\\) respectively. We will further assume that these are normally distributed.\nAs with the intercept \\(\\beta_{0i}\\), the slope of the predictor \\(\\beta_{1i}\\) is now modelled by a mean \\(\\gamma_{10}\\) and a random effect for each group (\\(\\zeta_{1i}\\)).\nR command:\n\nlmer(outcome ~ predictor + (1 + predictor | grouping), data = dataframe)\n\nNote: this is the same as lmer(outcome ~ predictor + (predictor | grouping), data = dataframe) .

As such, random effects are another form of residual, and our assumptions of zero mean constant variance apply at both levels of residuals (see Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The black dashed lines show our model assumptions.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can assess these normality of both resid(model) and ranef(model) by constructing plots using functions such as hist(), qqnorm() and qqline().\n\nWe can also use plot(model, type=c(\"p\",\"smooth\")) to give us our residuals vs fitted plot (smooth line should be horizontal at approx zero, showing zero mean).\n\nplot(model, form = sqrt(abs(resid(.))) ~ fitted(.), type = c(\"p\",\"smooth\")) will give us our scale-location plot (smooth line should be horizontal, showing constant variance).\n\nWe can also use the check_model() function from the performance package to get lots of info at once:\n\nlibrary(performance)\ncheck_model(random_slopes_model)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf approximations\nlikelihood-based\ncase-based bootstrap\n\n\n\n\ntests or CIs for model parameters\nlibrary(parameters)model_parameters(model, ci_method=\"kr\")\nconfint(model, type=\"profile\")\nlibrary(lmeresampler)bootstrap(model, .f=fixef, type=\"case\", B = 2000, resample = c(??,??))\n\n\nmodel comparison(different fixed effects, same random effects)\nlibrary(pbkrtest)KRmodcomp(model1,model0)\nanova(model0,model)\n\n\n\n\nfit models with REML=TRUE.good option for small samples\nfit models with REML=FALSE.needs large N at both levels (40+)\ntakes time, needs careful thought about which levels to resample, but means we can relax distributional assumptions (e.g. about normality of residuals)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising Model Fitted values\n\n\n\n\n\nThe model fitted (or “model predicted”) values can be obtained using predict() (returning just the values) or broom.mixed::augment() (returning the values attached to the data that is inputted to the model).\nTo plot, them, we would typically like to plot the fitted values for each group (e.g. subject)\n\nlibrary(broom.mixed)\naugment(random_slopes_model) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(.,aes(x=x1, y=.fitted, group=subject))+\n  geom_line()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualising Fixed Effects\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to plot the fixed effects from our model, we have to do something else. Packages like sjPlot make it incredibly easy (but sometimes too easy), so a nice option is to use the effects package to construct a dataframe of the linear prediction accross the values of a predictor, plus standard errors and confidence intervals. We can then pass this to ggplot(), giving us all the control over the aesthetics.\n\n# a quick option:  \nlibrary(sjPlot)\nplot_model(random_slopes_model, type = \"eff\")\n\n\n# when you want more control\nlibrary(effects)\nef &lt;- as.data.frame(effect(term=\"x1\",mod=random_slopes_model))\nggplot(ef, aes(x=x1,y=fit, ymin=lower,ymax=upper))+\n  geom_line()+\n  geom_ribbon(alpha=.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting random effects\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quick and easy way to plot your random effects is to use the dotplot.ranef.mer() function in lme4.\n\nrandoms &lt;- ranef(random_slopes_model, condVar=TRUE)\ndotplot.ranef.mer(randoms)\n\n$subject\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNested and Crossed structures\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same principle we have seen for one level of clustering can be extended to clustering at different levels (for instance, observations are clustered within subjects, which are in turn clustered within groups).\nConsider the example where we have observations for each student in every class within a number of schools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion: Is “Class 1” in “School 1” the same as “Class 1” in “School 2”?\nNo.\nThe classes in one school are distinct from the classes in another even though they are named the same.\nThe classes-within-schools example is a good case of nested random effects - one factor level (one group in a grouping varible) appears only within a particular level of another grouping variable.\nIn R, we can specify this using:\n(1 | school) + (1 | class:school)\nor, more succinctly:\n(1 | school/class)\nConsider another example, where we administer the same set of tasks at multiple time-points for every participant.\nQuestion: Are tasks nested within participants?\nNo.\nTasks are seen by multiple participants (and participants see multiple tasks).\nWe could visualise this as the below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the sense that these are not nested, they are crossed random effects.\nIn R, we can specify this using:\n(1 | subject) + (1 | task)\n\nNested vs Crossed\nNested: Each group belongs uniquely to a higher-level group.\nCrossed: Not-nested.\n\nNote that in the schools and classes example, had we changed data such that the classes had unique IDs (e.g., see below), then the structures (1 | school) + (1 | class) and (1 | school/class) would give the same results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMLM in a nutshell\n\n\n\n\n\nMLM allows us to model effects in the linear model as varying between groups. Our coefficients we remember from simple linear models (the \\(\\beta\\)’s) are modelled as a distribution that has an overall mean around which our groups vary. We can see this in Figure 2, where both the intercept and the slope of the line are modelled as varying by-groups. Figure 2 shows the overall line in blue, with a given group’s line in green.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Multilevel Model. Each group (e.g. the group in the green line) deviates from the overall fixed effects (the blue line), and the individual observations (green points) deviate from their groups line\n\n\n\n\nThe formula notation for these models involves separating out our effects \\(\\beta\\) into two parts: the overall effect \\(\\gamma\\) + the group deviations \\(\\zeta_i\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n& \\text{for observation }j\\text{ in group }i \\\\\n\\quad \\\\\n& \\text{Level 1:} \\\\\n& \\color{red}{y_{ij}}\\color{black} = \\color{blue}{\\beta_{0i} \\cdot 1 + \\beta_{1i} \\cdot x_{ij}}\\color{black} + \\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\\n& \\text{Level 2:} \\\\\n& \\color{blue}{\\beta_{0i}}\\color{black} = \\gamma_{00} + \\color{orange}{\\zeta_{0i}} \\\\\n& \\color{blue}{\\beta_{1i}}\\color{black} = \\gamma_{10} + \\color{orange}{\\zeta_{1i}} \\\\\n\\quad \\\\\n& \\text{Where:} \\\\\n& \\gamma_{00}\\text{ is the population intercept, and }\\color{orange}{\\zeta_{0i}}\\color{black}\\text{ is the deviation of group }i\\text{ from }\\gamma_{00} \\\\\n& \\gamma_{10}\\text{ is the population slope, and }\\color{orange}{\\zeta_{1i}}\\color{black}\\text{ is the deviation of group }i\\text{ from }\\gamma_{10} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n\\]\nThe group-specific deviations \\(\\zeta_{0i}\\) from the overall intercept are assumed to be normally distributed with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_0^2\\). Similarly, the deviations \\(\\zeta_{1i}\\) of the slope for group \\(i\\) from the overall slope are assumed to come from a normal distribution with mean \\(0\\) and variance \\(\\sigma_1^2\\). The correlation between random intercepts and slopes is \\(\\rho = \\text{Cor}(\\zeta_{0i}, \\zeta_{1i}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{01}}{\\sigma_0 \\sigma_1}\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{bmatrix} \\zeta_{0i} \\\\ \\zeta_{1i} \\end{bmatrix}\n\\sim N\n\\left(\n    \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix},\n    \\begin{bmatrix}\n        \\sigma_0^2 & \\rho \\sigma_0 \\sigma_1 \\\\\n        \\rho \\sigma_0 \\sigma_1 & \\sigma_1^2\n    \\end{bmatrix}\n\\right)\n\\]\nThe random errors, independently from the random effects, are assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero\n\\[\n\\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)\n\\]\nWe fit these models using the R package lme4, and the function lmer(). Think of it like building your linear model lm(y ~ 1 + x), and then allowing effects (i.e. things on the right hand side of the ~ symbol) to vary by the grouping of your data. We specify these by adding (vary these effects | by these groups) to the model:\n\nlibrary(lme4)\nm1 &lt;- lmer(y ~ x + (1 + x | group), data = df)\nsummary(m1)\n\nLinear mixed model fit by REML ['lmerMod']\nFormula: y ~ x + (1 + x | group)\n   Data: df\n\nREML criterion at convergence: 637.9\n\nScaled residuals: \n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-2.49449 -0.57223 -0.01353  0.62544  2.39122 \n\nRandom effects:\n Groups   Name        Variance Std.Dev.

Each participant completed the route 3 times (i.e. “repeated measures”), but each time they were listening to different audio (either speech, classical music or rap music). Their average speed across the route was recorded. This is a fairly simple design, that we might use to ask “how is the type of audio being listened to associated with driving speeds?”\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drivingmusicwithin.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    pid\nParticipant Identifier\n    speed\nAvg Speed Driven on Route (mph)\n    music\nMusic listened to while driving (classical music / rap music / spoken word)\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 2: CBT and Stress\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data are simulated to represent data from 50 participants, each measured at 3 different time-points (pre, during, and post) on a measure of stress. Participants were randomly allocated such that half received some cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment, and half did not. This study is interested in assessing whether the two groups (control vs treatment) differ in how stress changes across the 3 time points.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/stressint.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    ppt\nParticipant Identifier\n    stress\nStress (range 0 to 100)\n    time\nTime (pre/post/during)\n    group\nWhether participant is in the CBT group or control group\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 3: Erm..

Fluency of the statements was counterbalanced such that 15 participants heard statements 1 to 10 as fluent and 11 to 20 as disfluent, and the remaining 15 participants heard statements 1 to 10 as disfluent, and 11 to 20 as fluent. The order of the statements presented to each participant was random. Participants rated each statement on how believable it is on a scale of 0 to 100.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/erm_belief.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    ppt\nParticipant Identifier\n    trial_n\nTrial number\n    sentence\nStatement identifier\n    condition\nCondition (fluent v disfluent)\n    belief\nbelief rating (0-100)\n    statement\nStatement\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 4: Cognitive Aging\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data are simulated to represent a large scale international study of cognitive aging, for which data from 17 research centers has been combined. The study team are interested in whether different cognitive domains have different trajectories as people age. Do all cognitive domains decline at the same rate? Do some decline more steeply, and some less? The literature suggests that scores on cognitive ability are predicted by educational attainment, so they would like to control for this.\nEach of the 17 research centers recruited a minimum of 14 participants (Median = 21, Range 14-29) at age 45, and recorded their level of education (in years). Participants were then tested on 5 cognitive domains: processing speed, spatial visualisation, memory, reasoning, and vocabulary. Participants were contacted for follow-up on a further 9 occasions (resulting in 10 datapoints for each participant), and at every follow-up they were tested on the same 5 cognitive domains. Follow-ups were on average 3 years apart (Mean = 3, SD = 0.8).\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cogdecline.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    cID\nCenter ID\n    pptID\nParticipant Identifier\n    educ\nEducational attainment (years of education)\n    age\nAge at visit (years)\n    processing_speed\nScore on Processing Speed domain task\n    spatial_visualisation\nScore on Spatial Visualisation domain task\n    memory\nScore on Memory domain task\n    reasoning\nScore on Reasoning domain task\n    vocabulary\nScore on Vocabulary domain task"

Once a week for 5 consecutive weeks, participants were asked to complete two questionnaires, one assessing their level of hunger, and one assessing their level of irritability. The time and day at which participants were assessed was at a randomly chosen hour between 7am and 7pm each week. 46 of the participants were following a five-two diet (five days of normal eating, 2 days of fasting), and the remaining 35 were following no specific diet.\nDATASET: https://uoepsy.github.io/data/hangry.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    q_irritability\nScore on irritability questionnaire (0:100)\n    q_hunger\nScore on hunger questionnaire (0:100)\n    ppt\nParticipant Identifier\n    fivetwo\nWhether the participant follows the five-two diet\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest-enhanced learning\n\n\n\n\n\nAn experiment was run to conceptually replicate “test-enhanced learning” (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006): two groups of 25 participants were presented with material to learn. One group studied the material twice (StudyStudy), the other group studied the material once then did a test (StudyTest). Recall was tested immediately (one minute) after the learning session and one week later. The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (Test_word).\nThe researchers are interested in how test-enhanced learning influences time-to-recall. The critical (replication) prediction is that the StudyTest group will retain the material better (lower reaction times) on the 1-week follow-up test compared to the StudyStudy group.\nDATASET: https://uoepsy.github.io/data/RTtestlearning.RData\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    Subject_ID\nUnique Participant Identifier\n    Group\nGroup denoting whether the participant studied the material twice (StudyStudy), or studied it once then did a test (StudyTest)\n    Delay\nTime of recall test ('min' = Immediate, 'week' = One week later)\n    Test_word\nWord being recalled (175 different test words)\n    Rtime\nTime to respond (milliseconds)\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMono/bilingual differences in vocabulary development\n\n\n\n\n\n74 children from 10 schools were administered the full Boston Naming Test (BNT-60) on a yearly basis for 5 years to examine development of word retrieval.

Every year, the parents were asked to fill out an informant-based version of the Aggressive Behaviour Scale (ABS), measuring verbal and physical abuse, socially inappropriate behavior, and resisting care. Where possible, the same parents were followed up throughout the child’s progression through high school. Alongside this, parents from a cohort of students entering 10 further high schools in the state were recruited to also complete the same informant-based ABS, but were not offered the PMT group sessions.\nThe commissioner has two main questions: Does the presentation of aggressive behaviours increase as children enter the secondary school system? If so, is there any evidence for the effectiveness of Parent Management Training (PMT) group sessions in curbing the rise of aggressive behaviors during a child’s transition into the secondary school system?\nDATASET: https://uoepsy.github.io/data/abs_intervention.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    schoolid\nSchool Name\n    ppt\nParticipant Identifier\n    age\nAge (years)\n    interv\nWhether or not parents attended Parent Management Training (PMT) group sessions (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\n    ABS\nAggressive Behaviours Scale.

Each participant completed the route 3 times (i.e. “repeated measures”), but each time they were listening to different audio (either speech, classical music or rap music). Their average speed across the route was recorded. This is a fairly simple design, that we might use to ask “how is the type of audio being listened to associated with driving speeds?”\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drivingmusicwithin.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    pid\nParticipant Identifier\n    speed\nAvg Speed Driven on Route (mph)\n    music\nMusic listened to while driving (classical music / rap music / spoken word)\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 2: CBT and Stress\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data are simulated to represent data from 50 participants, each measured at 3 different time-points (pre, during, and post) on a measure of stress. Participants were randomly allocated such that half received some cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment, and half did not. This study is interested in assessing whether the two groups (control vs treatment) differ in how stress changes across the 3 time points.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/stressint.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    ppt\nParticipant Identifier\n    stress\nStress (range 0 to 100)\n    time\nTime (pre/post/during)\n    group\nWhether participant is in the CBT group or control group\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 3: Erm.. I don’t believe you\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data are simulated to represent data from 30 participants who took part in an experiment designed to investigate whether fluency of speech influences how believable an utterance is perceived to be.\nEach participant listened to the same 20 statements, with 10 being presented in fluent speech, and 10 being presented with a disfluency (an “erm, …”). Fluency of the statements was counterbalanced such that 15 participants heard statements 1 to 10 as fluent and 11 to 20 as disfluent, and the remaining 15 participants heard statements 1 to 10 as disfluent, and 11 to 20 as fluent. The order of the statements presented to each participant was random. Participants rated each statement on how believable it is on a scale of 0 to 100.\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/erm_belief.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    ppt\nParticipant Identifier\n    trial_n\nTrial number\n    sentence\nStatement identifier\n    condition\nCondition (fluent v disfluent)\n    belief\nbelief rating (0-100)\n    statement\nStatement\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice 4: Cognitive Aging\n\n\n\n\n\nThese data are simulated to represent a large scale international study of cognitive aging, for which data from 17 research centers has been combined. The study team are interested in whether different cognitive domains have different trajectories as people age. Do all cognitive domains decline at the same rate? Do some decline more steeply, and some less? The literature suggests that scores on cognitive ability are predicted by educational attainment, so they would like to control for this.\nEach of the 17 research centers recruited a minimum of 14 participants (Median = 21, Range 14-29) at age 45, and recorded their level of education (in years). Participants were then tested on 5 cognitive domains: processing speed, spatial visualisation, memory, reasoning, and vocabulary. Participants were contacted for follow-up on a further 9 occasions (resulting in 10 datapoints for each participant), and at every follow-up they were tested on the same 5 cognitive domains. Follow-ups were on average 3 years apart (Mean = 3, SD = 0.8).\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cogdecline.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      variable\n      description\n    \n  \n  \n    cID\nCenter ID\n    pptID\nParticipant Identifier\n    educ\nEducational attainment (years of education)\n    age\nAge at visit (years)\n    processing_speed\nScore on Processing Speed domain task\n    spatial_visualisation\nScore on Spatial Visualisation domain task\n    memory\nScore on Memory domain task\n    reasoning\nScore on Reasoning domain task\n    vocabulary\nScore on Vocabulary domain task"

If you have an error message in R, copy the error message into google. The results returned can sometimes just cause more confusion, but sometimes something might jump out at you and help you solve the problem. The same applies with searching the internet for help with statistics - search for “what is a p-value”, and you’ll find many many different articles and forum discussions etc. Some of them you will find too technical, but don’t be scared - the vast majority of people work in statistics will find these too technical too. Some of them you might feel are too simple/not helpful. As a general guide, keep clicking around the search responses, and you may end up finding that someone, somewhere, has provided an explanation at the right level. If you find something during your search which you don’t quite understand, feel free to link it in a post on the discussion forum!"

    "text": "Likelihood\nFor likelihood, we are interested in hypotheses about our coin. Do we think it is a fair coin (for which the probability of heads is 0.5?).\nTo consider these hypotheses, we need to observe some data, and so we need to have a given number of tosses, and a given number of heads. Whereas above we varied the number of heads, and fixed the parameter that designates the true chance of landing on heads for any given toss, for the likelihood we fix the number of heads observed, and can make statements about different possible parameters that might govern the coins behaviour.\nFor example, if we did observe 2 heads in 8 tosses, what is the likelihood of this data given various parameters?\nOur parameter can take any real number between from 0 to 1, but let’s do it for a selection:\n\nposs_parameters = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.05)\ndbinom(2, 8, poss_parameters)\n\n [1] 0.000000e+00 5.145643e-02 1.488035e-01 2.376042e-01 2.936013e-01\n [6] 3.114624e-01 2.964755e-01 2.586868e-01 2.090189e-01 1.569492e-01\n[11] 1.093750e-01 7.033289e-02 4.128768e-02 2.174668e-02 1.000188e-02\n[16] 3.845215e-03 1.146880e-03 2.304323e-04 2.268000e-05 3.948437e-07\n[21] 0.000000e+00\n\n\nSo what we are doing here is considering the possible parameters that govern our coin. Given that we observed 2 heads in 8 coin tosses, it seems very unlikely that the coin weighted such that it lands on heads 80% of the time (e.g., the parameter of 0.8 is not likely). You can visualise this as below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFormalizing the intuition We have a stochastic process that takes discrete values (i.e. outcomes of tossing a coin 10 times). We calculated the probability of observing a particular set of outcomes (8 correct predictions) by making assumptions about the underlying stochastic process, that is, the probability that our test subject can correctly predict the outcome of the coin toss is (p) (e.g. 0.8). We also assumed implicitly that the coin tosses are independent."
