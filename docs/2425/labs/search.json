    "text": "Data: gadeduc.csv\nThis is synthetic data from a randomised controlled trial, in which 30 therapists randomly assigned patients (each therapist saw between 4 and 30 patients) to a control or treatment group, and monitored their scores over time on a measure of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD7 - a 7 item questionnaire with 5 point likert scales).\nThe control group of patients received standard sessions offered by the therapists. For the treatment group, 10 mins of each sessions was replaced with a specific psychoeducational component, and patients were given relevant tasks to complete between each session. All patients had monthly therapy sessions. Generalised Anxiety Disorder was assessed at baseline and then every visit over 4 months of sessions (5 assessments in total).\nThe data are available at https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_gadeduc.csv\nYou can find a data dictionary below:\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Data Dictionary: msmr_gadeduc.csv\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\npatient\nA patient code in which the labels take the form &lt;Therapist initials&gt;_&lt;group&gt;_&lt;patient number&gt;.\n\n\nvisit_0\nScore on the GAD7 at baseline\n\n\nvisit_1\nGAD7 at 1 month assessment\n\n\nvisit_2\nGAD7 at 2 month assessment\n\n\nvisit_3\nGAD7 at 3 month assessment\n\n\nvisit_4\nGAD7 at 4 month assessment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 1\n\n\nUh-oh… these data aren’t in the same shape as the other datasets we’ve been giving you..\nCan you get it into a format that is ready for modelling?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s wide, and we want it long.\n\nOnce it’s long. “visit_0”, “visit_1”,.. needs to become the numbers 0, 1, …\nOne variable (patient) contains lots of information that we want to separate out. There’s a handy function in the tidyverse called separate(), check out the help docs!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - reshaping\n\n\n\nHere’s the data. We have one row per patient, but we have multiple observations for each patient across the columns..\n\ngeduc = read_csv(\"../../data/msmr_gadeduc.csv\")\nhead(geduc)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 6\n  patient        visit_0 visit_1 visit_2 visit_3 visit_4\n  &lt;chr&gt;            &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 OT_Control_1        26      27      27      27      27\n2 OT_Control_2        25      24      27      26      25\n3 OT_Treatment_3      26      27      24      23      22\n4 OT_Treatment_4      26      26      26      25      25\n5 ND_Control_1        25      25      25      25      25\n6 ND_Control_2        26      24      25      24      23\n\n\nWe can make it long by taking the all the columns from visit_0 to visit_4 and shoving their values into one variable, and keeping the name of the column they come from as another variable:\n\ngeduc |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(2:last_col(), names_to=\"visit\",values_to=\"GAD\")\n\n# A tibble: 2,600 × 3\n   patient      visit     GAD\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 OT_Control_1 visit_0    26\n 2 OT_Control_1 visit_1    27\n 3 OT_Control_1 visit_2    27\n 4 OT_Control_1 visit_3    27\n 5 OT_Control_1 visit_4    27\n 6 OT_Control_2 visit_0    25\n 7 OT_Control_2 visit_1    24\n 8 OT_Control_2 visit_2    27\n 9 OT_Control_2 visit_3    26\n10 OT_Control_2 visit_4    25\n# ℹ 2,590 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 - time is numeric\n\n\n\nNow we know how to get our data long, we need to sort out our time variable (visit) and make it into numbers.\nWe can replace all occurrences of the string \"visit_\" with nothingness \"\", and then convert them to numeric.\n\ngeduc |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(2:last_col(), names_to=\"visit\",values_to=\"GAD\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    visit = as.numeric(gsub(\"visit_\",\"\",visit))\n  ) \n\n# A tibble: 2,600 × 3\n   patient      visit   GAD\n   &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 OT_Control_1     0    26\n 2 OT_Control_1     1    27\n 3 OT_Control_1     2    27\n 4 OT_Control_1     3    27\n 5 OT_Control_1     4    27\n 6 OT_Control_2     0    25\n 7 OT_Control_2     1    24\n 8 OT_Control_2     2    27\n 9 OT_Control_2     3    26\n10 OT_Control_2     4    25\n# ℹ 2,590 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 - splitting up the patient variable\n\n\n\nFinally, we need to sort out the patient variable. It contains 3 bits of information that we will want to have separated out. It has the therapist (their initials), then the group (treatment or control), and then the patient number. These are all separated by an underscore “_“.\nThe separate() function takes a column and separates it into several things (as many things as we give it), splitting them by some user defined separator such as an underscore:\n\ngeduc_long &lt;- geduc |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(2:last_col(), names_to=\"visit\",values_to=\"GAD\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    visit = as.numeric(gsub(\"visit_\",\"\",visit))\n  ) |&gt;\n  separate(patient, into=c(\"therapist\",\"group\",\"patient\"), sep=\"_\")\n\nAnd we’re ready to go!\n\ngeduc_long\n\n# A tibble: 2,600 × 5\n   therapist group   patient visit   GAD\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 OT        Control 1           0    26\n 2 OT        Control 1           1    27\n 3 OT        Control 1           2    27\n 4 OT        Control 1           3    27\n 5 OT        Control 1           4    27\n 6 OT        Control 2           0    25\n 7 OT        Control 2           1    24\n 8 OT        Control 2           2    27\n 9 OT        Control 2           3    26\n10 OT        Control 2           4    25\n# ℹ 2,590 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 2\n\n\nVisualise the data. Does it look like the treatment had an effect?\nDoes it look like it worked for every therapist?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremember, stat_summary() is very useful for aggregating data inside a plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nHere’s the overall picture. The average score on the GAD7 at each visit gets more and more different between the two groups. The treatment looks effective..\n\nggplot(geduc_long, aes(x = visit, y = GAD, col = group)) +\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s split this up by therapist, so we can see the averages across each therapist’s set of patients.\nThere’s clear variability between therapists in how well the treatment worked. For instance, the therapists PT and GI don’t seem to have much difference between their groups of patients.\n\nggplot(geduc_long, aes(x = visit, y = GAD, col = group)) +\n  stat_summary(geom=\"pointrange\") +\n  facet_wrap(~therapist)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nFit a model to test if the psychoeducational treatment is associated with greater improvement in anxiety over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n1 - fixed effects\n\n\n\nWe want to know if how anxiety (GAD) changes over time (visit) is different between treatment and control (group).\nHopefully this should hopefully come as no surprise1 - it’s an interaction!\n\nlmer(GAD ~ visit * group + ...\n       ...\n     data = geduc_long)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 - grouping structure\n\n\n\nWe have multiple observations for each of the 520 patients, and those patients are nested within 30 therapists.\nNote that in our data, the patient variable does not uniquely specify the individual patients. i.e. patient “1” from therapist “OT” is a different person from patient “1” from therapist “ND”. To correctly group the observations into different patients (and not ‘patient numbers’), we need to have therapist:patient.\nSo we capture therapist-level differences in ( ... | therapist) and the patients-within-therapist-level differences in ( ... | therapist:patient):\n\nlmer(GAD ~ visit * group + ...\n       ( ... | therapist) + \n       ( ... | therapist:patient),\n     data = geduc_long)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 - random effects\n\n\n\nNote that each patient can change differently in their anxiety levels over time - i.e. the slope of visit could vary by participant.\nLikewise, some therapists could have patients who change differently from patients from another therapist, so visit|therapist can be included.\nEach patient is in one of the two groups - they’re either treatment or control. So we can’t say that “differences in anxiety due to treatment varies between patients”, because for any one patient the “difference in anxiety due to treatment” is not defined in our study design.\nHowever, therapists see multiple different patients, some of which are in the treatment group, and some of which are in the control group. So the treatment effect could be different for different therapists!\n\nmod1 &lt;- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|therapist:patient),\n             geduc_long)\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nFor each of the models below, what is wrong with the random effect structure?\n\nmodelA &lt;- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|patient),\n             geduc_long)\n\n\nmodelB &lt;- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist/patient),\n             geduc_long)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nmodelA &lt;- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist)+\n               (1+visit|patient),\n             geduc_long)\n\nThe patient variable doesn’t capture the different patients within therapists, so this actually fits crossed random effects and treats all data where patient==1 as from the same group (even if this includes several different patients’ worth of data from different therapists!)\n\nmodelB &lt;- lmer(GAD ~ visit*group + \n               (1+visit*group|therapist/patient),\n             geduc_long)\n\nUsing the / here means we have the same random slopes fitted for therapists and for patients-within-therapists. but the effect of group can’t vary by patient, so this doesn’t work. hence why we need to split them up into (...|therapist)+(...|therapist:patient).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nLet’s suppose that I don’t want the psychoeducation treatment, I just want the standard therapy sessions that the ‘Control’ group received. Which therapist should I go to?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\ndotplot.ranef.mer() might help here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nIt would be best to go to one of the therapists WG, EQ, or EI…\nWhy? These therapists all have the most negative slope of visit:\n\ndotplot.ranef.mer(ranef(mod1))$therapist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nRecreate this plot.\nThe faint lines represent the model estimated lines for each patient. The points and ranges represent our fixed effect estimates and their uncertainty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou can get the patient-specific lines using augment() from the broom.mixed package, and the fixed effects estimates using the effects package.\nremember you can pull multiple datasets into ggplot:\n\n\nggplot(data = dataset1, aes(x=x,y=y)) + \n  geom_point() + # points from dataset1\n  geom_line(data = dataset2) # lines from dataset2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(effects)\nlibrary(broom.mixed)\neffplot &lt;- effect(\"visit*group\",mod1) |&gt;\n  as.data.frame()\n\naugment(mod1) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    upatient = paste0(therapist,patient)\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=visit,y=.fitted,col=group))+\n  stat_summary(geom=\"line\", aes(group=upatient,col=group), alpha=.1)+\n  geom_pointrange(data=effplot, aes(y=fit,ymin=lower,ymax=upper,col=group))+\n  labs(x=\"- Month -\",y=\"GAD7\")"

If you have an error message in R, copy the error message into google. The results returned can sometimes just cause more confusion, but sometimes something might jump out at you and help you solve the problem. The same applies with searching the internet for help with statistics - search for “what is a p-value”, and you’ll find many many different articles and forum discussions etc. Some of them you will find too technical, but don’t be scared - the vast majority of people work in statistics will find these too technical too. Some of them you might feel are too simple/not helpful. As a general guide, keep clicking around the search responses, and you may end up finding that someone, somewhere, has provided an explanation at the right level. If you find something during your search which you don’t quite understand, feel free to link it in a post on the discussion forum!"
